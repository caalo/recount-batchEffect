Overall design: mRNA levels for 7 breast cancer cell lines treated with one of three CDK4/6 inhibitors (abemaciclib, palbociclib, or ribociclib) at either 0.3 uM, 1.0 uM (only for MCF7), or 3.0 uM for either 6 or 24 hours."

To improve our understanding of the transcriptional and epigenetic events associated with autophagy, we performed genome-wide transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling after nutrient deprivation in human wildtype and autophagy-deficient cells. We observed that nutrient deprivation leads to the transcriptional induction of numerous autophagy-associated genes. These transcriptional changes are reflected at the epigenetic level (H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K56ac) and are independent of autophagic flux. Overall design: Transcriptome analysis of HAP1 WT, ATG7KO and RB1CC1KO cells with and without amino acid + serum starvation (6h EBSS). For each sample 3 replicates were included."

Here, we use a novel Dual RNA-seq approach for a single-step simultaneous RNA profiling in both pathogen and host to reveal molecular phenotypes of sRNAs during infection with Salmonella Typhimurium. We identify a new PhoP/Q-activated small RNA which upon bacterial internalization acts to temporally control the expression of both, invasion-associated effectors and virulence genes required for intracellular survival. This riboregulatory activity is shown to adjust the human response to replicating Salmonella, and have a pervasive impact on host RNA expression both inside and outside protein-coding regions including infection-specific alterations of an array of long noncoding RNAs. Our study provides a paradigm for a comprehensive RNA-based analysis of intracellular bacterial pathogens without their physical purification from a host and a new discovery route for hidden functions of pathogen genes.

We identified MED12 and MED24 in an optical pooled CRISPR knockout screen in HeLa-Cas9 cells for genes affecting the activation and/or relaxation of p65 to the cytoplasm following induction by either TNFa or IL-1b. We generated isogenic clonal knockout HeLa-Cas9 lines using crRNA transfection and confirmed that loss of MED12 or MED24 results in delayed relaxation of p65, assayed by live-cell imaging of a p65-mNeonGreen fluorescent fusion. Overall design: Biological replicates were defined as replicate clonal knockout cell lines (for MED12 and MED24 knockouts) or replicate stimulations (for parental control cells) (n = 3 or 4 biological replicates)."
"human","data_sources/sra","SRP071965",355,"A blood RNA signature for tuberculosis disease risk: a prospective cohort study","Identification of blood biomarkers that prospectively predict progression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis  infection to tuberculosis disease might lead to interventions that combat the tuberculosis epidemic. We aimed to  assess whether global gene expression measured in whole blood of healthy people allowed identification of prospective  signatures of risk of active tuberculosis disease. RESULTS:Between July 6, 2005, and April 23, 2007, we enrolled 6363 from the ACS study and 4466 from independent  South African and Gambian cohorts. 46 progressors and 107 matched controls were identified in the ACS cohort. A  16 gene signature of risk was identified. The signature predicted tuberculosis progression with a sensitivity of 66·1%  (95% CI 63·2–68·9) and a specificity of 80·6% (79·2–82·0) in the 12 months preceding tuberculosis diagnosis. The  risk signature was validated in an untouched group of adolescents (p=0·018 for RNA sequencing and p=0·0095 for  qRT-PCR) and in the independent South African and Gambian cohorts (p values <0·0001 by qRT-PCR) with a  sensitivity of 53·7% (42·6–64·3) and a specificity of 82·8% (76·7–86) in 12 months preceding tuberculosis. Interpretation: The whole blood tuberculosis risk signature prospectively identified people at risk of developing active  tuberculosis, opening the possibility for targeted intervention to prevent the disease. Overall design: In this prospective cohort study, we followed up healthy, South African adolescents aged 12–18 years from  the adolescent cohort study (ACS) who were infected with M tuberculosis for 2 years. We collected blood samples from  study participants every 6 months and monitored the adolescents for progression to tuberculosis disease. A prospective  signature of risk was derived from whole blood RNA sequencing data by comparing participants who developed  active tuberculosis disease (progressors) with those who remained healthy (matched controls). After adaptation to  multiplex qRT-PCR, the signature was used to predict tuberculosis disease in untouched adolescent samples and in  samples from independent cohorts of South African and Gambian adult progressors and controls. Participants of the  independent cohorts were household contacts of adults with active pulmonary tuberculosis disease."

We used scRNA-seq to survey CD4+ T regulatory (Treg) and memory T (Tmem) cells in spleen, lymph nodes, skin and colon in an unbiased way, in mouse and human. This cross-tissues, cross-species comparison allows us to obtain marker genes for immune populations in specific locations with likely relevance for human studies. Additionally, a continuous phenotype of Treg migration can be modelled from the mouse data, unravelling the transcriptional stages through which these cells transition between tissues."

For this we sequenced total RNA from 18 psoriasis patients (before and after treatment) and 16 healthy controls. We created our own reference set of long non-coding RNAs by merging three long non-coding RNA reference data sets. The combined reference had 67,157 lncRNA transcripts with no overlaps. We identified differential expression of 971 lncRNAs between PP and NN, 157 between PP and PT, and 377 between PT and NN. Based on differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs between PP and NN, we identified a molecular lncRNA signature that distinguishes psoriatic skin from healthy skin . Overall design: We recruited 18 psoriatic patients in our study. We took 5 mm punch biopsies from the edge of a psoriatic plaque before treatment and after one month of treatment with adalimumab. The mean improvement in the PASI over this time period was 53.1%. We obtained sixteen normal skin samples (N=16) from healthy control surgical discard specimens."
"human","data_sources/sra","SRP166112",864,"Acquired HER2 mutations in ER+ metastatic breast cancer confer resistance to ER-directed therapies","Estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers that develop resistance to therapies that target the ER are the most common cause of breast cancer death. Beyond mutations in ER, which occur in 25-30% of patients treated with aromatase inhibitors (AIs), our understanding of clinical mechanisms of resistance to ER-directed therapies remains incomplete. We identified activating HER2 mutations in metastatic biopsies from eight patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer who had developed resistance to ER-directed agents, including AIs, tamoxifen, and fulvestrant. Examination of treatment-naïve primary tumors in five patients revealed no evidence of pre-existing mutations in four of five patients, suggesting that these mutations were acquired under the selective pressure of ER-directed therapy. These mutations were mutually exclusive with ER mutations, suggesting a distinct mechanism of acquired resistance to ER-directed therapies. In vitro analysis confirmed that these mutations conferred estrogen independence. In addition, and in contrast to ER mutations, these mutations resulted in resistance to tamoxifen, fulvestrant, and the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib. Resistance was overcome by combining ER-directed therapy with the irreversible HER2 kinase inhibitor neratinib, highlighting an effective treatment strategy in these patients. Overall design: Examination of the transcriptional output (mRNA) of  the HER2 activating mutations compared with controls under various drugs. Specifically, we expressed the activating mutations S653C, L755S, V777L, and L869R  in ER+/HER2- breast cancer cell line (T47D), and controls (GFP, wild-type HER2, kinase-dead HER2, and ESR1 Y537S). Cell were then treated with DMSO, 1µM fulvestrant, 1µM neratinib, 10µM palbociclib, 1µM fulvestrant + 1µM neratinib, or 1µM fulvestrant + 10µM palbociclib for 24 hours. All experimental conditions were done in 6 replicates, sequenced in 3 replicates"
"human","data_sources/sra","SRP144912",770,"Pericyte-to-neuron reprogramming via unfolding of a neural stem cell-like program","Ectopic expression of defined transcription factors can force direct cell fate conversion from one lineage to another in the absence of cell division. Several transcription factor cocktails have enabled successful reprogramming of various somatic cell types into induced neurons (iNs) of distinct neurotransmitter phenotype. However, the nature of the intermediate states that drive the reprogramming trajectory towards distinct iN types is largely unknown. Here we show that successful direct reprogramming of adult human brain pericytes into functional iNs by Ascl1 and Sox2 (AS) encompasses transient activation of a neural stem cell-like gene expression program that precedes bifurcation into distinct neuronal lineages. Intriguingly, during this transient state key signaling components relevant for neural induction and neural stem cell maintenance are regulated and functionally contribute to iN reprogramming and maturation. Thus, AS-mediated reprogramming into a broad spectrum of iN types involves the unfolding of a developmental program via neural stem cell-like intermediates. Overall design: Single-cell transcriptomes from multiple time points and conditions during direct conversion of human pericytes into induced pericytes through the overexpression of defined factors. Please note that [1] the *ctrl samples represent mock-transfected cells (analyzed along side of the transfected cells) [2] The cell type (for each sample) is provided as 'pericytes or pericyte-derived induced neuronal cells' (as they are in a differentiation continuum from pericytes to neurons due to the treatment protocol) with the combination of 'genotype/variation' and 'time point' information."
"human","data_sources/sra","SRP144212",56,"CDK12 mediated transcriptional regulation in U2OS cells","While activation of canonical NF-?B signaling through the IKK complex is well studied, few regulators of NIK-dependent non-canonical p52 nuclear translocation have been identified. We discovered a novel role for cyclin dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) in transcriptionally regulating the non-canonical NF-?B pathway. High-content phenotypic screening identified a novel compound, 919278, which inhibits lymphotoxin ß receptor (LTßR)- and FN14-dependent p52 nuclear translocation, but not TNFa receptor (TNFR)-mediated, canonical NF-?B p65 nuclear translocation. Chemoproteomics identified cyclin dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) as the target of 919278. CDK12 inhibition by 919278, THZ1, or siRNA knock down all affect similar global transcriptional changes and prevent LTßR and FN14-dependent MAP3K14 (NIK) mRNA induction and subsequent protein accumulation. In addition, 919278 and THZ1 treatment reduce RNA Pol II CTD phosphorylation. This powerful approach of coupling a phenotypic screen with chemoproteomics revealed a novel regulatory pathway of the non-canonical NF-?B pathway that could serve as a therapeutic target in autoimmunity and cancer. Overall design: There are TWEAK stimulated and unstimulated conditions, 4hr and 24hr time points. 7 treatments (DMSO, BIO0702697, BIO0919278, BIO032202, NTsiRNA, siRNAs523626, siRNAs523629) in duplicates.

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP119312",60,"Integrated analysis of motif activity and gene expression changes of transcription factors","The ability to predict transcription factors based on sequence information in regulatory elements is a key step in systems-level investigation of transcriptional regulation. Here, we have developed a novel tool, IMAGE, for precise prediction of transcription factors based on transcriptome profiling and genome-wide maps of enhancer activity. High precision is obtained by combining a near-complete database of position weight matrices (PWMs), generated by compiling public databases and systematic prediction of PWMs for uncharacterized transcription factors, with a state-of-the-art method for PWM scoring and a novel machine learning strategy, based on both enhancers and promoters, to predict the contribution of motifs to transcriptional activity. We applied IMAGE to published data obtained during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and showed that IMAGE predicts causal transcriptional regulators of this process with higher confidence than other methods. Furthermore, we generated genome-wide maps of enhancer activity and transcripts during human mesenchymal stem cell commitment and adipocyte differentiation and used IMAGE to identify positive and negative transcriptional regulators of this process. Collectively, our results demonstrate that IMAGE is a powerful and precise method for prediction of regulators of gene expression.

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP055918",80,"Evaluating intra- and inter-individual variation in the human placental transcriptome","Background: Gene expression variation is a phenotypic trait of particular interest as it represents the initial link between genotype and other phenotypes. Analyzing how such variation apportions among and within groups allows for the evaluation of how genetic and environmental factors influence such traits. It also provides opportunities to identify genes and pathways that may have been influenced by non-neutral processes. Here we use a population genetics framework and next generation sequencing to evaluate how gene expression variation is apportioned among four human groups in a natural biological tissue, the placenta. Results: We estimate that on average, 33.2%, 58.9% and 7.8% of the placental transcriptome is explained by variation within individuals, among individuals and among human groups, respectively.  Additionally, when technical and biological traits are included in models of gene expression they account for roughly 2% of total gene expression variation. Notably, the variation that is significantly different among groups is enriched in biological pathways associated with immune response, cell signaling and metabolism. Many biological traits demonstrated correlated changes in expression in numerous pathways of potential interest to clinicians and evolutionary biologists. Finally, we estimate that the majority of the human placental transcriptome (65% of expressed genes) exhibits expression profiles consistent with neutrality; the remainder are consistent with stabilizing selection (26%), directional selection (4.9%), or diversifying selection (4.8%). Conclusion: We apportion placental gene expression variation into individual, population and biological trait factors and identify how each influence the transcriptome. Additionally, we advance methods to associate expression profiles with different forms of selection. Overall design: Placental mRNA was sequenced on an Illumina GAIIx. Samples were derived from 4 human groups, 10 individuals per group, 2 samples per individual"

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP114518",91,"Genomic signatures of platinum re-sensitization in ovarian cancer [RNA-Seq]","Epigenetic changes, particularly DNA methylation aberrations have been implicated in acquired resistance to platinum in ovarian cancer. A multi-institutional randomized clinical trial compared a regimen of a DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) inhibitor guadecitabine and carboplatin to physician's choice chemotherapy for patients with recurrent platinum resistant ovarian cancer. Tumor biopsies or malignant ascites were collected at day 1 of cycle 1 (pre-guadecitabine) and after two cycles of treatment (post-decitabine). The goal of the current study was to analyze guadecitabine-induced DNA methylation and gene expression changes and correlate pretreatment levels with clinical outcomes. Epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HM450) and RNA sequencing revealed extensive methylation and gene expression changes induced by guadecitabine in ovarian tumors. Ninety-four gene promoters were significantly hypomethylated after treatment with guadecitabine and 949 genes were differentially expressed in pre vs. post-treatment tumors. Pathways associated with immune reactivation and DNA repair were significantly altered by guadecitabine treatment.  Expression levels of 1155 genes involved in 25 networks on day 1 of cycle 1 correlated with progression free survival. Increased expression of selected genes (e.g. DOK2, miR193a) silenced through promoter methylation restored platinum sensitivity in ovarian cancer cells.  Together, these results support that guadecitabine altered DNA methylation and expression of genes and gene networks correlate with re-sensitization to carboplatin in ovarian cancer patients. Overall design: 93 samples are analyzed, including tumor samples collected from patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer before treated by guadecitabine and after treated by guadecitabine."

Here, we examined genetic variants, fusion transcripts, SNP genotyping, and gene expression patterns for early-stage (I, II) ovarian carcinomas (n=96) in relation to clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcome, thereby identifying novel genetic features of ovarian carcinomas. Furthermore, mutation frequencies of specific genetic variants and/or their gene expression patterns were associated with histotype and overall survival, e.g. SLC28A2 (mucinous ovarian carcinoma histotype), ARCN1 (low expression in 0-2 year survival group), and tumor suppressor MTUS1 (mutation status and overall survival). The long non-coding RNA MALAT1 was identified as a highly promiscuous fusion transcript in ovarian carcinoma. Moreover, gene expression deregulation for 23 genes was associated with tumor aggressiveness.

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP058181",73,"mRNA-Seq expression and MS3 proteomics profiling of human post-mortem BA9 brain tissue for Parkinson Disease and neurologically normal individuals","Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (SNCA) and other proteins in aggregates termed “Lewy Bodies” within neurons. PD has both genetic and environmental risk factors, and while processes leading to aberrant protein aggregation are unknown, past work points to abnormal levels of SNCA and other proteins. Although several genome-wide studies have been performed for PD, these have focused on DNA sequence variants by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and on RNA levels (microarray transcriptomics), while genome-wide proteomics analysis has been lacking. After appropriate filters, proteomics identified 3,558 unique proteins and 283 of these (7.9%) were significantly different between PD and controls (q-value<0.05). RNA-sequencing identified 17,580 protein-coding genes and 1,095 of these (6.2%) were significantly different (FDR p-value<0.05), but only 166 of the FDR significant protein-coding genes (0.94%) were present among the 3,558 proteins characterized. Of these 166, eight genes (4.8%) were significant in both studies, with the same direction of effect. Functional enrichment analysis of the proteomics results strongly supports mitochondrial-related pathways, while comparable analysis of the RNA-sequencing results implicates protein folding pathways and metallothioneins. Ten of the implicated genes or proteins co-localized to GWAS loci. Evidence implicating SNCA was stronger in proteomics than in RNA-sequencing analyses.

All current sequence-based HLA typing methodologies are targeted approaches requiring the amplification of specific HLA gene segments. Whole genome, exome and transcriptome shotgun sequencing can generate prodigious data but due to the complexity of HLA loci these data have not been immediately informative regarding HLA genotype. We describe HLAminer, a computational method for identifying HLA alleles directly from shotgun sequence datasets (http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/hlaminer). This approach circumvents the additional time and cost of generating HLA-specific data and capitalizes on the increasing accessibility and affordability of massively parallel sequencing."

Here, we compared the diurnal transcriptome of human skeletal muscle conducted on serial muscle biopsies in vivo with profiles of human skeletal myotubes synchronized in vitro. Extensive rhythmic transcription was observed in human skeletal muscle in comparison to in vitro cell culture. However, nearly half of the in vivo rhythmicity was lost at the mRNA accumulation level. siRNA-mediated clock disruption in primary myotubes significantly affected the expression of ~8% of all genes, with impact on glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Genes involved in GLUT4 expression, translocation and recycling were negatively affected, whereas lipid metabolic genes were altered to promote activation of lipid utilization. Moreover, basal and insulin stimulated glucose uptake were significantly reduced upon CLOCK depletion. Altogether, our findings suggest an essential role for cell-autonomous circadian clocks in coordinating muscle glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism in humans. Overall design: 10 candidates with 6 biopsies each for a total of 57 samples being sequenced. Together with GSE109825, part of the same study described above."

Methods: A cohort of 113 patients with NSCLC diagnosed between April 2008 and September 2014 who had preoperative CT data and tumor tissue available was studied. For each tumor, a thoracic radiologist recorded 87 semantic image features, selected to reflect radiologic characteristics of nodule shape, margin, texture, tumor environment, and overall lung characteristics. Next, total RNA was extracted from the tissue and analyzed with RNA sequencing technology. Ten highly coexpressed gene clusters, termed metagenes, were identified, validated in publicly available gene-expression cohorts, and correlated with prognosis. Next, a radiogenomics map was built that linked semantic image features to metagenes by using the t statistic and the Spearman correlation metric with multiple testing correction. Results: RNA sequencing analysis resulted in 10 metagenes that capture a variety of molecular pathways, including the epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway. A radiogenomic map was created with 32 statistically significant correlations between semantic image features and metagenes. Conclusions: Radiogenomic analysis of NSCLC showed multiple associations between semantic image features and metagenes that represented canonical molecular pathways Overall design: We studied 130 cases of NSCLC with CT, PET/CT and RNASeq data under IRB approval from Stanford University and the Veterans Administration Palo Alto Health Care System. The collection of tissue samples consisted of a distribution of poorly- to well-differentiated adenocarcinomas and squamous cell cancers. The surgeon had removed necrotic debris during excision and sampled cavitary lesions to include as much solid component as practical.

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP049820",83,"An Endotoxin Tolerance Signature Predicts Sepsis and Organ Dysfunction at Initial Clinical Presentation","Background: Sepsis involves aberrant immune responses to infection, but the exact nature of this immune dysfunction remains poorly defined. Bacterial endotoxins like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are potent inducers of inflammation, which has been associated with the pathophysiology of sepsis, but repeated exposure can also induce a suppressive effect known as endotoxin tolerance or cellular reprogramming. It has been proposed that endotoxin tolerance might be associated with the immunosuppressive state that was primarily observed during late-stage sepsis. However, this relationship remains poorly characterised. Here we clarify the underlying mechanisms and timing of immune dysfunction in sepsis. Methods: We defined a gene expression signature characteristic of endotoxin tolerance. Gene-set test approaches were used to correlate this signature with early sepsis, both newly and retrospectively analysing microarrays from 593 patients in 11 cohorts. Then we recruited a unique cohort of possible sepsis patients at first clinical presentation in an independent blinded controlled observational study to determine whether this signature was associated with the development of confirmed sepsis and organ dysfunction. Findings: All sepsis patients presented an expression profile strongly associated with the endotoxin tolerance signature (p < 0.01; AUC 96.1%). Importantly, this signature further differentiated between suspected sepsis patients who did, or did not, go on to develop confirmed sepsis, and predicted the development of organ dysfunction. Interpretation: Our data support an updated model of sepsis pathogenesis in which endotoxin tolerance-mediated immune dysfunction (cellular reprogramming) is present throughout the clinical course of disease and related to disease severity. Thus endotoxin tolerance might offer new insights guiding the development of new therapies and diagnostics for early sepsis. Overall design: For the RNA-Seq study reported here, 73 patients were recruited with deferred consent at the time of first examination in an emergency ward based on the opinion of physicians that there was a potential for the patient''s condition to develop into sepsis. These were retrospectively divided into groups based on clinical features and compared to 11 non-urgent surgical controls."

Attempts to develop a pathophysiologically relevant animal model that develops villous atrophy (VA) have failed. The need to develop non-dietary treatments for this common disorder is now widely recognized, but it is hampered by the lack of a preclinical model. Furthermore, while human studies have led to major advances in our understanding of CeD pathogenesis, direct demonstration of the respective roles of disease-predisposing HLA molecules, and adaptive and innate immunity in the development of tissue damage is missing. To address these unmet needs, we engineered a mouse model that reproduces the dual overexpression of IL-15 in the gut epithelium and the lamina propria (Lp) characteristic of active CeD, expresses the predisposing HLA-DQ8 molecule, and develops VA upon gluten ingestion. We show that overexpression of IL-15 in both the epithelium and Lp is required for development of VA, demonstrating the location-dependent central role of IL-15 in CeD pathogenesis. Furthermore, our study reveals the critical role played by both CD4+ and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in VA development. Finally, it establishes that HLA-DQ8 is central for tissue destruction, but dispensable for loss of oral tolerance to gluten. This mouse model, by reflecting the complex interplay between gluten, genetics and the IL-15-driven tissue inflammation found in CeD, represents a powerful preclinical model to test new therapeutics and study disease pathogenesis. Overall design: We collected RNA-sequencing data from duodenal biopsies obtained from 51 CeD patients and 45 healthy controls."

Here, a time-course genome-wide transcriptional profiling of transduced human HSPC reveals a remarkably limited impact of LV on cellular gene expression, supporting some stealth features of the vector. In particular, LV efficiently escaped innate immune sensing that instead led to robust type I IFN signaling upon transduction with a gamma-retroviral vector. However, recognition of LV DNA prior to integration did trigger DNA damage responses that were activated also by non-integrating Adeno-associated vector DNA. As a consequence of this transient p53 activation, transduced HSPC showed increased apoptosis in vitro and reduced engraftment in vivo at limiting cell doses, but no long-term impact or competitive disadvantage were detected. Pharmacological inhibition of the LV signaling partially rescued both apoptosis and engraftment, potentially providing a novel strategy to further dampen the impact of ex vivo gene therapy on HSPC. Overall, our results shed light on the molecular mechanisms of viral vector sensing in HSPC and provide critical insight for the development of more stealth gene therapy strategies.

This dataset consists of patient derived neurons that go through all consecutive developmental stages (NSC-derived neurons) as well as a comparative set of iPSC-iNs (neurons generated from the same patients that bypass early NSC-like stages using an Ngn2-transgene approach). For this, we first used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to purify a homogeneous population of NSCs based on the expression of the cell-surface markers CD184+/CD271-/CD44-/CD24-/CD15+. To trace ASD and control neurons over time, we performed a series of retroviral lineage-tracing experiments to trace the progenies of dividing NSCs using a retroviral vector expressing a membrane-tagged enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) (CAG::LckN-eGFP). As differentiating neurons express PSA-NCAM on the cell surface, we established a FACS-based protocol for purification of defined subpopulations of retrovirally labeled eGFP+/PSA-NCAM+ double-positive neurons after 2, 4, 7 and 14 days of differentiation.

Transcriptomic analyses have previously been performed from bulk skin samples or from epithelial and immune cells expanded in cell culture. However, transcriptomic analysis of bulk skin tends to drown out expression signals from relatively rare cells while cell culture methods may significantly alter cellular phenotypes and gene expression profiles. To identify distinct transcriptomic profiles of multiple cell populations without substantially altering cell phenotypes, we employed a fluorescence activated cell sorting method to isolate keratinocytes, dendritic cells, CD4+ T effector cells, and CD8+ T effector cells from healthy skin samples, followed by RNA-seq of each cell population. Principal components analysis revealed distinct clustering of cell types across samples, while differential expression and coexpression network analyses revealed transcriptional profiles of individual cell populations distinct from bulk skin, most strikingly in the least abundant CD8+ T effector population. Our work provides a high resolution view of cutaneous cellular gene expression and suggests that transcriptomic profiling of bulk skin may inadequately capture the contribution of less abundant cell types. Overall design: Transcriptomic profiles from keratinocyte, dendritic cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell populations were obtained from surgical skin discards from 11 healthy adults.

These iPSCs are highly similar to embryonic stem cells and can be used for regenerative medicine, drug screening and disease modelling. Despite recent advances, reprogramming is a slow and inefficient process. This suggests that there are several safeguarding mechanisms to counteract cell fate conversion. Cellular senescence is one of these barriers, which is mediated through activation of the tumour suppressors p53/p21CIP1, p15INK4b and p16INK4a.   In this study, we have screened for shRNAs blunting reprogramming-induced senescence.

Purpose: To characterise the cellular/molecular mechanisms underlying infant AVB in circulating cells/local airways tissues. Methods: PBMC and nasal mucosal scrapings (NMS) were obtained from Infants (<18mths) and children (1.5-5yrs) during AVB and post-convalescence. Immune response patterns were profiled by multiplex analysis of plasma cytokines, flow cytometry, and transcriptomics (RNA-Seq). Molecular profiling of group-level data utilised a combination of upstream regulator and coexpression network analysis, followed by individual subject-level data analysis employing personalised N-of-1-pathways methodology. Results: Group-level analyses demonstrated that infant PBMC responses were dominated by monocyte-associated hyper-upregulated type I interferon signalling/pro-inflammatory pathways (drivers: TNF, IL6, TREM1, IL1B), versus a combination of inflammation (PTGER2, IL6) plus growth/repair/remodelling pathways (ERBB2, TGFB1, AREG, HGF) coupled with Th2 and NK-cell signalling in children. Age-related differences were not attributable to differential steroid usage or variations in underlying viral pathogens. Nasal mucosal responses were comparable qualitatively in infants/children, dominated by interferon types I-III, but the magnitude of upregulation was higher in infants (range 6-48-fold) than children (5-17-fold). N-of-1-pathways analysis confirmed differential upregulation of innate immunity in infants and NK cell networks in children, and additionally demonstrated covert AVB response sub-phenotypes that were independent of chronological age. Conclusions: Dysregulated expression of interferon-dependent pathways following respiratory viral infections is a defining immunophenotypic feature of AVB-susceptible infants and a subset of children. Susceptible subjects appear to represent a discrete subgroup who cluster based on (slow) kinetics of postnatal maturation of innate immune competence. Overall design: The study design consisted of PBMC from infants (<18months, n=15 pairs) and pre-school children (2-5yrs, n=16 pairs) sampled during severe acute viral bronchiolitis (acute visit = AV) and following recovery during convalescence (convalescent visit = CV).

While 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is important for imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and transcriptional repression, the function of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is less well defined. Recent studies indicate that 5hmC can be stable and long-lived in some cell types, suggesting roles beyond a DNA demethylation intermediate. Here we show that oxidation of 5mC to 5hmC enhances transcription of a specific repertoire of genes. 5hmC upregulates transcription by counteracting the repressive effects of promoter-proximal 5mC, while supressing the ability of gene body resident spurious transcription initiation sites to produce mature transcripts. By contrast, the equivalent hypomethylation results in chaotic gene expression potentiating a broad collection of genes and cryptic promoters. Our observations provide an explanation why some post-mitotic cell types favour high 5hmC in the genomes, while equivalent global hypomethylation is rarely observed.

We then performed RNA sequencing on whole blood collected at the time of biopsy in 88 patients (22 vs. 66) to identify transcripts associated with histological abnormalities. Subjects with subclinical ACR or borderline ACR at 3 month (ACR-3) had higher risk of subsequent clinical acute rejection at 12 and 24 month (P < 0.05), more rapid functional decline (P < 0.05) and a decreased graft survival in adjusted cox analysis (P < 0.01) than patients with no abnormalities on 3-month biopsy.

We examine 1.2 million CpG and CpH sites in enhancers in prefrontal cortex neurons of individuals with no/mild, moderate, and severe AD pathology (n=101). We identify 1,224 differentially methylated enhancer regions; most of which are hypomethylated at CpH sites in AD neurons. CpH methylation losses occur in normal aging neurons, but are accelerated in AD. Integration of epigenetic and transcriptomic data demonstrates a pro-apoptotic reactivation of the cell cycle in post-mitotic AD neurons. Furthermore, AD neurons have a large cluster of significantly hypomethylated enhancers in the DSCAML1 gene that targets BACE1. Hypomethylation of these enhancers in AD is associated with an upregulation of BACE1 transcripts and an increase in amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive decline. Overall design: In order to identify enhancers involved in AD, we comprehensively mapped DNA methylation at enhancers, genome-wide, in neurons isolated from the prefrontal cortex of 106 individuals with no/mild, moderate and severe AD pathology (Braak stage: I-II n=38, III-IV n=32, and V-VI n=36).

This work presents a novel potent and selective BET inhibitor (BI 894999), which has recently entered clinical trials (NCT02516553). In preclinical studies, this compound is highly active in AML cell lines, primary patient samples, and xenografts. HEXIM1 is described as an excellent pharmacodynamic biomarker for target engagement in tumors as well as in blood. Mechanistic studies show that BI 894999 targets super-enhancer-regulated oncogenes and other lineage-specific factors, which are involved in the maintenance of the disease state. BI 894999 is active as monotherapy in AML xenografts, and in addition leads to strongly enhanced antitumor effects in combination with CDK9 inhibitors. This treatment combination results in a marked decrease of global p-Ser2 RNA polymerase II levels and leads to rapid induction of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Together, these data provide a strong rationale for the clinical evaluation of BI 894999 in AML. Overall design: We performed ChIP-seq experiments in 22 samples covering 4 different cell lines and 3 different antibodies (H3K27ac, BRD4, RNA Pol-II).

Here, we performed single-cell DNA methylome sequencing for human preimplantation embryos and found that tens of thousands of genomic loci exhibited de novo DNA methylation. This finding indicates that genome-wide DNA methylation reprogramming during preimplantation development is a dynamic balance between strong global demethylation and significant focused re-methylation. Furthermore, the demethylation of the paternal genome is much faster and thorough than that of the maternal genome. From the 2-cell to post-implantation stage, methylation of the paternal genome is consistently lower than that on the maternal genome. We also showed that the genetic lineage of the early blastomeres could be traced by DNA methylation analysis. Our work paves the way for deciphering the secrets of DNA methylation reprogramming in human early embryos.

Therapeutic strategies that combine MEK inhibitors with agents that target apoptotic pathways may be a promising therapeutic approach. We investigated combining MEK and MDM2 inhibitors as a potential treatment strategy for KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancers and colorectal carcinomas that harbor wild-type TP53. The combination of pimasertib (MEK inhibitor) + SAR405838 (MDM2 inhibitor) was synergistic and induced the expression of PUMA and BIM, led to apoptosis and growth inhibition in vitro, and tumor regression in vivo. Acquired resistance to the combination commonly resulted from the acquisition of TP53 mutations, conferring complete resistance to MDM2 inhibition. In contrast, resistant clones exhibited marked variability in sensitivity to MEK inhibition, which significantly impacted sensitivity to subsequent treatment with alternative MEK inhibitor-based combination therapies. These results highlight both the potential promise and limitations of combining MEK and MDM2 inhibitors for treatment of KRAS mutant NSCLC and CRC.

IL-3 shares a common beta subunit receptor with both IL-5 and GM-CSF, but through alpha subunit-specific properties, uniquely influences eosinophil biology and may serve as a potential therapeutic target. Objective: We aimed to globally characterize the transcriptomic profiles of GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5 stimulation and identify differences in gene expression using advanced statistical modeling. Methods: Human eosinophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers and stimulated with either GM-CSF, IL-3 or IL-5 for 48 hours. RNA was then extracted and bulk sequencing performed. DESeq analysis identified differentially expressed genes and weighted gene co-expression network analysis independently defined modules of genes that are highly co-expressed. Results: IL-3 stimulation yielded the most numbers of differentially expressed genes that were also highly co-expressed. GM-CSF and IL-5 stimulation demonstrated redundancy in eosinophil gene expression. Conclusion: IL-3 produces a distinct eosinophil gene expression program among the beta-chain receptor cytokines. Overall design: A total of 28 samples were analyzed (7 eosinophil donors, with each eosinophil collection split and independently subjected to 4 conditions - unstimulated, GM-CSF stimulated, IL-3 stimulated, IL-5 stimuated).

P  value < 0.05) following  abatacept  treatment in Tfh, Treg and CD4+CD45RO+PD1+CXCR5- T cells, respectively. We determined if abatacept treatment altered the core transcriptional profiles of Tfh and Treg lineages by comparing gene expression of bulk sorted Treg and Tfh cells from cryopreserved PBMCs at baseline, week 24, and after abatacept withdrawal.  Analysis of differentially expressed (DE) genes in Tfh was performed using Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis.  This analysis revealed 9 significantly enriched GO categories, which were related to processes involved in cell division and proliferation. DE genes in the enriched GO categories showed a highly significant correlation in Tfh and Treg cells, further highlighting the similarity in the response of these two populations to abatacept. In contrast to Tfh and Treg, acatacept had a minimal impact on CD4+CD45RO+PD1+CXCR5- T cells. Overall design: Tfh, Treg and CD4+CD45RO+PD1+CXCR5- T cells populations were sorted from 30 different donors from blood draws at 3 different visits weeks 0, 24, and 52. 500 cells of each subset were sorted directly into SMARTseq v4 (Takara) lysis buffer to release RNA, and RT-PCR then used to generate cDNA.

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP219876",140,"West Nile virus infection of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells","West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic flavivirus and the leading cause of mosquito-borne encephalitis in the United States. Recent studies in humans have found that dysfunctional T cell responses strongly correlate with development of severe WNV neuroinvasive disease. However, the contributions of human dendritic cells (DCs) in priming WNV-specific T cell immunity remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that human monocyte derived DCs (moDCs) support productive viral replication following infection with a pathogenic strain of WNV. Antiviral effector gene transcription was strongly induced during the log-phase viral growth, while secretion of type I interferons (IFN) occurred with delayed kinetics. Activation of RIG-I like receptor (RLR) or type I IFN signaling prior to log-phase viral growth significantly diminished viral replication, suggesting that early activation of antiviral programs can block WNV infection. In contrast to the induction of antiviral responses, WNV infection did not promote transcription or secretion of pro-inflammatory (IL-6, GM-CSF, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL9) or T cell modulatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-12, IL-15). There was also minimal induction of molecules associated with antigen presentation and T cell priming, including the co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD86, and CD40. Functionally, WNV-infected moDCs dampened allogenic CD4 and CD8 T cell activation and proliferation. Combined, we propose a model where WNV subverts human DC activation to compromise priming of WNV-specific T cell immunity. Overall design: Human monocyte-derived DCs moDCs were generated from 5 donors and  treated with innate immune agonists for 12hr (RIG-I, MDA5, or IFNß) or infected with WNV (12hpi and 24hpi). Time matched mocks were left untreated and collected at 12 and 24 hours post-treatment.

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP047476",72,"Impact of regulatory variation from RNA to protein","Genetic variants that impact gene regulation are important contributors to human phenotypic variation. For this reason, considerable efforts have been made to identify genetic associations with differences in mRNA levels of nearby genes, namely, cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). The phenotypic consequences of eQTLs are presumably due, in most cases, to their ultimate effects on protein expression levels. Yet, only few studies have quantified the impact of genetic variation on proteins levels directly. It remains unclear how faithfully eQTLs are reflected at the protein level, and whether there is a significant layer of cis regulatory variation acting primarily on translation or steady state protein levels. To address these questions, we measured ribosome occupancy by high-throughput sequencing, and relative protein levels by high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry, in a panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) in which we had previously measured transcript expression using RNA sequencing. We then mapped genetic variants that are associated with changes in transcript expression (eQTLs), ribosome occupancy (rQTLs), or protein abundance (pQTLs). Most of the QTLs we detected are associated with transcript expression levels, with consequent effects on ribosome and protein levels. However, we found that eQTLs tend to have significantly reduced effect sizes on protein levels, suggesting that their potential impact on downstream phenotypes is often attenuated or buffered. Additionally, we confirmed the presence of a class of cis QTLs that specifically affect protein abundance with little or no effect on mRNA levels; most of these QTLs have little effect on ribosome occupancy, and hence may arise from differences in post-translational regulation. Overall design: We measured level of translation transcriptome-wide in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 72 HapMap Yoruba individuals using ribosome profiling assay, for which we have transcript level, protein level (62 out of 72) and genotype information collected."
"human","data_sources/sra","SRP119676",62,"New insights into diagnosis and therapeutic options for proliferative hepatoblastoma","Surgery and cisplatin-based treatment of hepatoblastoma (HB) currently guarantee the survival of 70-80% of patients. However, some important challenges remain in diagnosing high risk tumors and identifying relevant targetable pathways offering new therapeutic avenues. Previously, two molecular subclasses of hepatoblastoma tumors have been described, namely C1 and C2; C2 being the subgroup with the poorest prognosis, a more advanced tumor stage and the worst overall survival rate. An associated 16-gene signature to discriminate the two tumoral subgroups was proposed but it has not been transferred into clinical routine. To address these issues we performed RNA sequencing of 25 tumors and matched normal liver samples from patients. The transcript profiling separated HB into three distinct subgroups named C1, C2A and C2B, identifiable by a concise four-gene signature: HSD17B6, ITGA6, TOP2A and VIM, with TOP2A being characteristic for the proliferative C2A tumors. Differential expression of these genes was confirmed by RT-qPCR on an expanded cohort and by immunohistochemistry. We also revealed significant overexpression of genes involved in Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway in the  C2A subgroup. We then investigated the ability of several described FA inhibitors to block growth of HB cells in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that bortezomib, an FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor, strongly impairs the proliferation and survival of HB cell lines in vitro, blocks FA pathway associated double-strand DNA repair and significantly impedes HB growth in vivo.  In conclusion, the highly proliferating C2A subtype is characterized by TOP2A gene up-regulation and FA pathway activation and HB therapeutic arsenal could include Bortezomib for the treatment of patients with the most aggressive tumors.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the association between TP53 codon 72 polymorphism and somatic mutations in bladder cancer. Material and Method: Germline TP53 codon 72 polymorphism and somatic mutations of 50 cancer-associated genes were analyzed in 103 bladder cancer patients (59 non-muscle-invasive and 44 muscle-invasive), using Taqman genotyping assay and target sequencing, respectively. The expression of FGF-FGFR signaling pathway genes was analyzed by RNA sequencing of frozen tissue. Results: The allele frequency of TP53 codon 72 in our cohort was 37, 42, and 21% for Arg/Arg, Arg/Pro, and Pro/Pro, respectively. Interestingly, the prevalence of FGFR3 mutation was higher in patients with the Arg allele, whereas that of the RAS mutation was higher in patients without the Arg allele. The same association was seen in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients and no differences were observed in muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients. In NMIBC, FGFR1 expression was higher in patients without the Arg allele and FGFR3 expression was higher in patients with the Arg allele. Conclusion: Germline TP53 codon 72 polymorphism was associated with mutations of FGFR3 or RAS, and expression of FGFR1 and FGFR3 in NMIBC.

We observe a deep link between epigenetic zonation of human liver and a zonated expression of metabolic and morphogenic pathways: Key transcriptionally zonated enzymes in xenobiotic and glutamine metabolism show a strong anticorrelated methylation gradient indicating that zonal expression of these genes is partly controlled by epigenetic programs. Zonated DNA-methylation at binding sites of uniformly expressed transcription factors such as HNF4A and RXRa points to an epigenetic layer in regulatory networks and a zonated activity of their nuclear ligands and drugs such as fibrates and bile acids. The same holds for genes of the wnt morphogen pathway whose expression show a zonated methylation at binding sites of TCF4L2. A strong pericentral expression of LGR5 and AXIN2 and a corresponding expression gradient of the liver progenitor marker TBX3, indicates a predominant pericentral source of hepatocyte regeneration under steady-state conditions in humans. Conversely, the periportal expression of NOTCH and EPCAM at the border to the biliary tree as source of regeneration under injury conditions. Overall our data provide a deep understanding of molecular control of the zonal organisation in the human liver.

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP087576",70,"Adaptation of a RAS pathway activation signature from FF to FFPE tissues in colorectal cancer (FFPE RNA-Seq I)","Background: The KRAS gene is mutated in about 40% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases, which has been clinically validated as a predictive mutational marker of intrinsic resistatnce to anti-EGFR inhibitor (EGFRi) therapy. Since nearly 60% of patients with a wild type KRAS fail to respond to EGFRi treatment, there is a need to develop more reliable molecular signatures to better predict response. Here we address the challenge of adapting a gene expression signature predictive of RAS pathway activation, created using fresh frozen (FF) tissues, for use with more widely available formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Methods: In this study, we evaluated the translation of an 18-gene RAS pathway signature score from FF to FFPE in 54 CRC cases, using a head-to-head comparison of five technology platforms. FFPE-based technologies included the Affymetrix GeneChip (Affy), NanoString nCounter(NanoS), Illumina whole genome RNASeq (RNA-Acc), Illumina targeted RNASeq(t-RNA), and Illumina stranded Total RNA-rRNA-depletion (rRNA). Results: Using Affy_FF as the ""gold"" standard, initial analysis of the 18-gene RAS scores on all 54 samples shows varying pairwise Spearman correlations, with (1) Affy_FFPE(r=0.233, p=0.090); (2) NanoS_FFPE(r=0.608, p<0.0001); (3) RNA-Acc_FFPE(r=0.175, p=0.21); (4) t-RNA_FFPE (r=-0.237, p=0.085); and (5) t-RNA (r=-0.012, p=0.93). These results suggest that only NanoString has successful FF to FFPE translation. The subsequent removal of identified ""problematic"" samples (n=15) and gene (n=2) further improves the correlations of Affy_FF with three of the five technologies: Affy_FFPE (r=0.672, p<0.0001); NanoS_FFPE (r=0.738, p<0.0001); and RNA-Acc_FFPE (r=0.483, p=0.002). Conclusions: Of the five technology platforms tested, NanoString technology provides a more faithful translation of the RAS pathway gene expression signature from FF to FFPE than the Affymetrix GeneChip and multiple RNASeq technologies. Moreover, NanoString was the most forgiving technology in the analysis of samples with presumably poor RNA quality. Using this approach, the RAS signature score may now be reasonably applied to FFPE clinical samples. Overall design: Fifty-four (54) FFPE evaluable tumor specimens were selected from a larger multi-center cohort of 468 well-characterized colorectal adenocarcinoma patients whose tissues were obtained between October 2006 and September 2010 at the University of South Florida. The sample cohort was composed of tumor samples that were available as matched fresh-frozen (FF) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) pairs."

We studied human families with a unique recessive syndromic constellation of pontocerebellar atrophy with ambiguous genitalia, uncovering biallelic inactivating mutations in TOE1, which encodes a conserved unconventional deadenylase. TOE1 demonstrated tight association with snRNA-protein (snRNP) complexes with specificity for incompletely processed pre-snRNAs containing 3’ end extensions that often included post-transcriptionally added tails. Human cells deficient for TOE1 catalytic activity showed accumulation of 3’-end extended U1, U2, U4 and U5 pre-snRNAs, and TOE1 immuno-isolated from human cells was capable of processing 3’-end extended snRNPs in vitro. The missense mutations identified in patients impaired TOE1 stability and snRNA processing in patient cells, which was associated with defects in splicing. Our findings reveal the cause of a unique brain malformation and uncover a long-sought 3’ exonuclease required for snRNA processing. Overall design: We performed 154 experiments to profile snRNA tails for U1, U2, U4, and U5 snRNAs. Samples profiled include HEK 293, primary patient fibroblasts, and NPCs derived from primary patient fibroblasts, which were subjected to various treatments to study TOE1/cap1Z function (including siRNA of TOE1 compared to control siRNA, and over-expression of various TOE1 mutants compared to wild-type TOE1 and a FLAG-only control). For some indicated samples total RNA was used; for others in which FLAG-tagged TOE1 was over-expressed, profiling was performed on RNA isolated by RIP (RNA immunoprecipitation) using an anti-FLAG antibody."

Here we characterized the events triggering immune dysfunction in monocytes within alcoholic liver disease. Methods: We evaluated the frequency of monocyte subsets, their intracellular IL10 production, surface HLA-DR expression, and phagocytic and oxidative burst capacity in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, -alcoholic hepatitis or ACLF. RNAsequencing of ACLF patient-derived CD14+ monocytes were performed either immediately or after 12-hour culture in the presence or absence of plasma from ACLF patients. In this in vitro model of ACLF induction in CD14+ monocytes we characterized the early molecular, immunological and functional changes. Results: Besides a redistribution of monocyte subset composition, ACLF patient-derived monocytes featured elevated frequencies of IL-10-producing cells, reduced HLA-DR expression and impaired phagocytic- and oxidative burst capacity. RNAsequencing revealed a reprogramming of ACLF monocytes, whereby they undergo a transition from a pro-inflammatory to an immunosuppressive- and altered metabolic status. Culturing healthy monocytes in the presence of ACLF plasma, blunted their phagocytic capacity and triggered a gene expression pattern comparable to ACLF patients. Conversely, culturing patient monocytes in normal plasma restored their phagocytic capacity.  Finally, plasma IL-10 levels correlated with patient survival.  Conclusion:  ACLF monocytes featured a defective immunosuppressive and -glycolytic profile, an attribute which could be mimicked by culturing healthy monocytes in the presence of ACLF patient plasma. Our data implicate a role for IL-10 signaling pathways in triggering monocytes dysfunction and opens up new avenues for therapeutic targeting. Overall design: The study included 27 samples, RNA from purified CD14+ monocytes. 5 samples were from ACLF patients (cells immediately after isolation), 4 samples from healthy human controls immediately after isolation, 5 ACLF patients in vitro cultured in the presence of pool of ACLF serum,  5 ACLF patients in vitro cultured in the presence of pool of normal human serum, 4 healthy controls in vitro cultured in the presence of pool of ACLF serum,  4 healthy controls in vitro cultured in the presence of pool of normal human serum."

It is associated with improvements in metabolic and non metabolic co-morbidities which are thought to be mediated by a decrease of adipose tissue inflammation. However, the molecular mechanisms behind these beneficial effects are poorly understood. We analyzed expression profiles in subcutaneous adipose tissue from 22 obese women before and 3 months after surgery using the RNA-seq technology. Of 15,972 detected genes, 1214 were differentially expressed after surgery. Upregulated genes were mostly involved in the basal cellular machinery. Downregulated genes were enriched in metabolic functions of adipose tissue. At baseline, we identified 26 modules of coexpressed genes. The four most stable modules reflected the innate and adaptive immune responses of adipose tissue, including a general signature of innate immune cells, an adaptive immune response elicited by T lymphocytes, a neutrophil-mediated inflammatory signature and an interferon-signaling pathway, respectively. After surgery, a few crucial molecules involved in chemotaxis and activation of immune cells were disconnected from their respective networks. These molecules may represent therapeutic targets against adipose inflammation.

Since cancer initiation is complex we used a multi-omic approach to identify gene expression patterns that distinguish COPD stroma in patients with or without lung cancer. We obtained lung tissue from patients with COPD and lung cancer (tumor and adjacent non-malignant tissue) and those with COPD without lung cancer for proteomic and mRNA (cytoplasmic and polyribosomal) profiling.  We used the joint and individual variation explained (JIVE) method to integrate and analysis across the three datasets.  JIVE identified eight latent patterns that robustly distinguished and separated the three groups of tissue samples. Predictive variables that associated with the tumor, compared to adjacent stroma, were mainly represented in the transcriptomic data, whereas, predictive variables associated with adjacent tissue compared to controls was represented at the translatomic level. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed extracellular matrix (ECM) and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways as important signals in the pre-malignant stroma. COPD stroma adjacent to lung cancer is unique and differs from non-malignant COPD tissue and is distinguished by the extracellular matrix and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways.

We collected whole blood samples from children in Mexico having diarrhea associated with a single pathogen and without systemic complications. Our RNAseq data suggested that the blood signatures can differentiate children with diarrhea from healthy children either with or without bacterial colonization. Moreover, we detected different expression profiles from bacterial and viral infection, demonstrating for the first time the use of RNAseq to identify the etiology of infectious diarrhea.

We prospectively examined the pouch transcriptomes of UC and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) IPAA patients to unveil molecular mechanisms of UC pouchitis susceptibility. Methods: Total RNA was isolated using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Cat No. 8020). RNA quality was evaluated using Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). All RNA samples displayed RNA Integrity Number (RIN) >7. RNAseq including cDNA library preparation was processed at the Genomics Core Facility of University of Chicago (https://fgf.uchicago.edu/). Total RNA in the amount of 100-500µg per sample was depleted of ribosomal RNA using the Ribo-Zero kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI). The directional (first strand) cDNA libraries were prepared following the guide of TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Preparation kit. Results: Unlike FAP patients, UC subjects exhibited a large set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pouch and pre-pouch mucosa as early as 4 months after pouch functionalization. Functional pathway analysis of DEGs in UC pouch revealed: (1) Gain of colon-associated gene expressions and loss of ileum associated gene expressions, (2) enhanced state of immune/inflammatory response, and (3) suppressed xenobiotic, lipid, and bile acid metabolic pathways. These changes were corroborated upon reanalysis of a published larger cross-sectional study of UC and FAP patients. Moreover, >70% of DEGs mapped to published IBD and normal colonic microarray datasets displayed directional changes consistent with active UC, but not Crohn''s disease. Conclusions: UC patients exhibit a unique transcriptomic response to ileal pouch creation that can be observed well before disease.

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP056733",156,"Mycobacterial infection induces a specific human innate immune response","The innate immune system provides the first response to pathogen infection and orchestrates the activation of the adaptive immune system. Though a large component of the innate immune response is common to all infections, pathogen-specific innate immune responses have been documented as well. The innate immune response is thought to be especially critical for fighting infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). While TB can be a deadly disease, only 5-10% of individuals infected with MTB develop active disease, and this inter-individual variation is, at least partly, heritable. Studies of inter-individual variation in the innate immune response to MTB infection may therefore shed light on the genetic basis for variation in susceptibility to TB. Yet, to date, we still do not know which properties of the innate immune response are specific to MTB infection and which represent a general response to pathogen infection. To begin addressing this gap, we infected macrophages with eight different bacterial pathogens, including different MTB strains and related mycobacteria, and studied the transcriptional response to infection. We found that although the gene expression changes were largely consistent across the bacterial infection treatments, we were able to identify a novel subset of genes whose regulation was affected specifically by infection with mycobacteria. Genetic variants that are associated with regulatory differences in these genes should be considered candidate loci for explaining inter-individual susceptibility TB.

Here we show that distinct DNA methylation and transcriptome signatures not only discriminate RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from osteoarthritis FLS, but also distinguish RA FLS isolated from knees and hips. Using genome-wide methods, we show differences between RA knee and hip FLS in the methylation of genes encoding biological pathways, such as IL-6 signaling via JAK-STAT pathway. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes are identified between knee and hip FLS using RNA-seq. Double-evidenced genes that are both differentially methylated and expressed include multiple HOX genes.

We explored the transcriptional networks that CHD8 regulates in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) by reducing its expression and then integrating transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) with genome-wide CHD8 binding (ChIP-seq). Suppressing CHD8 to levels comparable with loss of a single allele caused altered expression of 1,756 genes, 64.9% of which were up-regulated.  CHD8 showed widespread binding to chromatin, with 7,324 replicated sites that marked 5,658 genes. Integration of these data suggests that a limited array of direct regulatory effects of CHD8 produced a much larger network of secondary expression changes. Genes indirectly down-regulated (i.e., without CHD8 binding sites) reflect pathways involved in brain development, including synapse formation, neuron differentiation, cell adhesion, and axon guidance, whereas CHD8-bound genes are strongly associated with chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation. Genes associated with ASD were strongly enriched among indirectly down-regulated loci (p = 1.01x10-9) and CHD8-bound genes (p = 4.34x10-3), which align with previously identified co-expression modules during fetal development. We also find an intriguing enrichment of cancer related gene-sets among CHD8-bound genes (p < 1.9x10-11). In vivo suppression of chd8 in zebrafish produced macrocephaly comparable to that of humans with inactivating mutations. These data indicate that heterozygous disruption of CHD8 precipitates a network of gene expression changes involved in neurodevelopmental pathways in which many ASD-associated genes may converge on shared mechanisms of pathogenesis. Overall design: RNA-seq in NPCs treated with shRNAs targeting CHD8. For controls, NPCs were treated with shRNAs targeting GFP and LacZ.

Here, we report a limited version established during the transition from the naive to the primed states of human cell pluripotency that reduces by orders of magnitude the combinatorial potential in the cPcdh locus. It is a chromatin-based mechanism that increases the frequency of stochastic selection of a subset of cPcdh promoters upon differentiation to fetal-like neurons in monolayers, organoids, or the rat spinal cord. Signs of similar preferential selections can be observed in the brain throughout fetal development, disappearing after birth, but not in a condition of delayed maturation such as Down Syndrome. We therefore propose that pluripotent cells impose a pattern of limited cPcdh diversity on neurons that increases the likelihood of cPcdh repetition until these cells acquire adult-like maturation. Overall design: Lines/sublines: The hiPSC1-8 sublines were generated from single cells of the parent CVB hiPSC line. Six of these sublines were genetically modified (hiPSC2-7) and two were cases of failed genome editing (hiPSC1 and 8); please see Supplementary Table S1 in the associated publication for more details.

However, it remains unclear how differences in the TCR contribute to heterogeneity in T cell state. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can allow simultaneous measurement of TCR sequence and global transcriptional profile from single cells. However, current methods for TCR inference from scRNA-seq are limited in their sensitivity and require long sequencing reads, thus increasing the cost and decreasing the number of cells that can be feasibly analyzed. We present TRAPeS, a publicly available tool that can efficiently extract TCR sequence information from short-read scRNA-seq libraries. We apply it to investigate heterogeneity in the CD8+ T cell response in humans and mice, and show that it is accurate and more sensitive than existing approaches. Coupling TRAPeS with transcriptome analysis of CD8+ T cells specific for a single epitope from Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), we show that the recently described “naive-like” memory population have significantly longer CDR3 regions and greater divergence from germline sequence than do effector-memory phenotype cells. This suggests that TCR usage is associated with the differentiation state of the CD8+ T cell response to YFV. Overall design: We applied and tested TRAPeS to scRNA-seq data from a range of CD8+ T cell responses. These data sets were selected to include both mouse and human CD8+ T cells as well as those expected to have a range of TCR complexities. In mice, we used the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection model, and profiled CD8+ T cells responding to either acute or chronic infection (using the Armstrong and Clone 13 strains of LCMV, respectively). In healthy human subjects we profiled naive CD8+ T cells, effector memory CD8+ T cells, and antigen-specific CD8+ T cells elicited by CMV infection; vaccination with the live attenuated yellow fever virus infection (YFV-17D); or by vaccination with adenoviral and modified vaccinia Ankara vectors encoding HCV proteins. We sorted up to 128 single CD8+ T cells from each dataset to a total of 565 cells, and generated scRNA-seq libraries with short (25-30bp) paired-end reads. To evaluate the accuracy of TRAPeS, we compared its output with that of directly sequencing the TCR sequence using long reads (in which reconstruction is not required). To that end, we sequenced libraries of epitope-specific cells for Clone 13, Armstrong and CMV, and naive T cells from the CMV donor with both short (25-30bp) paired-end and 150bp single-end sequence reads."

Stepwise RNA-seq data from this model shows that in the context of AML driven by the MLL-AF9 (MA9) oncogene, the genetic background of the donor does not have a detectable effect. Comparison of these model leukemias from multiple single donors to AML patient samples containing MA9 translocations revealed conserved gene expression patterns not previously highlighted in this genetic sub-type. We further demonstrate that the expression of one of these genes, RET, is essential both in vivo and in vitro growth of MA9 AMLs .

To investigate the underlying biology, we conduct single-cell RNA- sequencing (scRNA-seq) of >1500 cells from six primary TNBC. Intercellular heterogeneity of gene expression programs within each tumor was variable and largely correlated with clonality of inferred genomic copy number changes, suggesting that genotype drives the gene expression phenotype of individual subpopulations. Clustering of gene expression profiles identified distinct subgroups of malignant cells shared by multiple tumors, including a single subpopulation associated with multiple signatures of treatment resistance and metastasis, and characterized functionally by activation of glycosphingolipid metabolism and associated innate immunity pathways. A novel signature defining this subpopulation was predictive of long-term outcomes for TNBC patients in a large patient cohort. Collectively, this analysis reveals the functional heterogeneity and its association with genomic evolution in TNBC, and uncovers unanticipated biological principles dictating poor outcomes in this disease. Overall design: Single cell RNA sequencing of 1,534 cells in six fresh triple negative breast cancer tumors."

Transcriptional dysregulation in the human HD brain has been documented but is incompletely understood. Here we present a genome-wide analysis of mRNA expression in human prefrontal cortex from 20 HD and 49 neuropathologically normal controls using next generation high-throughput sequencing. Surprisingly, 19% (5,480) of the 28,087 confidently detected genes are differentially expressed (FDR<0.05) and are predominantly up-regulated. A novel hypothesis-free geneset enrichment method that dissects large gene lists into functionally and transcriptionally related groups discovers that the differentially expressed genes are enriched for immune response, neuroinflammation, and developmental genes. Markers for all major brain cell types are observed, suggesting that HD invokes a systemic response in the brain area studied. Unexpectedly, the most strongly differentially expressed genes are a homeotic gene set (represented by Hox and other homeobox genes), that are almost exclusively expressed in HD, a profile not widely implicated in HD pathogenesis. The significance of transcriptional changes of developmental processes in the HD brain is poorly understood and warrants further investigation. The role of inflammation and the significance of non-neuronal involvement in HD pathogenesis suggest anti-inflammatory therapeutics may offer important opportunities in treating HD.

We found that all of the kits were capable of performing significant ribosomal depletion, though there were differences in their ease of use. All kits were able to remove ribosomal RNA to below 20% with intact RNA and identify ~14,000 protein coding genes from the Universal Human Reference RNA sample at >1FPKM. Analysis of differentially detected genes among kits suggested that transcript length may be a key factor in library production efficiency. These results provide a roadmap for labs on the strengths of each of these methods and how best to utilize them. Overall design: The Universal Human Reference RNA (Agilent) was diluted to 500 ng/ul in 200ul of RNase-free water and 3.94ul of the Spike-in RNA Variant Control E2 Mix (Lexogen) were added. The sample was split into two aliquots, one of which was then heated at 94° C for 1 hour and 27 minutes. 1ul of ERCC RNA Spike-In Mix 1 was added to both the intact and degraded samples.

Methods: RNA from BE(2)-C cells transfected with control or specific siRNA's against indicated TREND regulator were processed according to TRENDseq protocol and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500 or NextSeq 500. Raw data was aligned to human genome hg38 and processed using TRENDseq analysis pipeline. BE(2)-C differentiation samples were processed using the 3'READS protocol (Hoque M et al. 2014, PMID 24590784)  Conclusions:   We analyzed the diversity of the transcriptome 3'end in response to depletion of 174 potential TREND regulators by RNAi. TRENDseq is capable to deconvolute the dynamics of TREND from highly multiplexed libraries. The screening revealed regulators of various levels of gene expression control (e.g. transcription, splicing, mRNA turnover, etc.) to play an important role in the diversification of the transcriptome 3' end, affecting over 3600 genes altogether.

Macrophages contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To understand this contribution it is necessary to distinguish macrophages from other MNPs, and identify functionally-different macrophage populations. We aimed to accurately identify intestinal macrophage populations, and to ascertain their functions in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: We developed 12-parameter flow cytometry protocols to identify and characterise human intestinal MNPs. We then used RNA sequencing, qPCR, and flow cytometry to analyse colonic biopsies from patients with CD, UC, or non-inflamed controls, in a cross-sectional study. RESULTS: We unambiguously differentiate macrophage populations (CD45+CD64+ HLA-DR+) from dendritic cells (CD45+CD64- HLA-DR+ CD11c;). We identify two distinct subsets within the macrophage population, differentiated by their expression of the mannose receptor, CD206. Further examination of these macrophage sub-populations showed that CD206+ macrophages expressed markers consistent with a mature macrophage phenotype: high levels of CD68 and CD163, higher transcription of IL-10 and lower expression of Trem1. On the contrary, CD64+ HLA-DR- CD206- cells appear to be semi-mature intermediaries in the development of mature intestinal macrophages from their monocyte precursors. CONCLUSIONS: We identified and purified MNP and macrophage populations from human intestinal lamina propria. Thorough characterisation reveals that human colonic macrophages appear to be derived from a monocytic precursor with high CCR2 and low CD206 expression. As these cells mature they lose their proliferative properties and acquire expression of IL-10, CD206, CD63, and CD168. Targeting the newly recruited monocyte-derived cells may represent a fruitful avenue to ameliorate chronic inflammation in IBD. Overall design: Examination of human colonic macrophages based on their CD206 expression. 15 samples analysed, divided between CD206+ (n=7) and CD206- (n=8)"

Although multiple functions have been ascribed to lincRNA, their synthesis and turnover remain poorly characterised. Here we define systematic differences in transcription and RNA processing between protein-coding and lincRNA genes in human HeLa cells. This is based on a range of nascent transcriptomic approaches applied to different nuclear fractions, including mammalian native elongating transcript sequencing (mNET-seq). Notably mNET-seq patterns specific for different Pol II CTD phosphorylation states reveal weak co-transcriptional splicing and poly(A) signal independent Pol II termination on lincRNA as compared to pre-mRNA. In addition, lincRNA are mostly restricted to chromatin where they are co-transcriptionally degraded by the RNA exosome. We also show that a lincRNA specific co-transcriptional RNA cleavage mechanism acts to induce premature termination. In effect functional lincRNA must escape from this targeted nuclear surveillance process. Overall design: We employed CTD phospho specific mNET-Seq with pla-B splicing inhibitor and RNA processing factors knockdown (DGCR8, Dicer1, EXOSC3 and CPSF73 proteins). mNET-seq experiments with 1% Empigen detergent treatment were performed to separate Pol II-associated complex from Pol II.

Currently, it is not understood how these loss-of-function mutations contribute to cancer development and how they can be targeted therapeutically. The cancer type specific occurrence patterns of certain subunit mutations suggest subunit-specific effects on BAF complex function, possibly by the formation of aberrant residual complexes. Here, we systematically characterize the effects of individual subunit loss on complex composition, chromatin accessibility and gene expression in a panel of knock-out cell lines deficient for 22 targetable BAF subunits. We observe strong, specific and often discordant alterations dependent on the targeted subunit and show that these explain intra-complex co-dependencies, including the novel synthetic lethal interactions SMARCA4-ARID2, SMARCA4-ACTB and SMARCC1-SMARCC2. These data provide insights into the role of different BAF subcomplexes in genome-wide chromatin organization and suggest novel approaches to therapeutically target BAF mutant cancers.

This study aimed to understand the transcriptional changes associated with the early development of ECA and the impact of doxycycline, which has anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties, upon these transcription patterns. One thousand Ethiopians undergoing trichiasis surgery were enrolled in a randomised controlled trial following informed consent. Equal groups of individuals were orally administered with 100mg/day of doxycycline or placebo for 28 days. Conjunctival swabs were collected immediately prior to surgery and at one- and six-months post-surgery. 3' mRNA sequencing was performed on paired baseline and one-month samples from 48 individuals; 24 from each treatment group. Within each treatment group, 12 individuals developed ECA. Treatment and outcome groups were matched by age, sex and baseline disease severity. qPCR validation was then performed for 46 genes of interest in 145 individuals who developed ECA at one month and 145 matched controls, using samples from baseline, one and six months. All treatment/outcome groups upregulated genes associated with wound healing pathways at one month relative to baseline, however no differences were detected between groups. The summed expression of a highly coexpressed cluster of pro-fibrotic genes was higher in patients that developed ECA in the placebo group relative to controls. qPCR validation revealed that all genes in this cluster and a number of other pro-inflammatory genes were strongly associated with ECA, however these associations were not modulated by trial arm. The development of post-operative ECA is associated with overexpression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes including growth factors, matrix metalloproteinases, collagens and extracellular matrix proteins.

As early as 8 weeks post conception, the majority of human foetuses move their right arms more than their left arms, but because nerve fibre tracts are still descending from the forebrain at this stage, spinal-muscular asymmetries are likely to play an important developmental role. Here we have used gene expression profiling in 18 human embryos to show that the left side of the human spinal cord, between four and eight weeks post conception, matures slightly faster than the right side, even though both sides transition from transcriptional profiles associated with cell division and proliferation at earlier stages, to later neuronal differentiation and function. The hindbrain showed a left-right mirrored pattern compared to the spinal cord.

To isolate and characterize relapse-inducing cells, we used genetic engineering and proliferation-sensitive dyes in patient-derived xenografts of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We identified a rare subpopulation that resembled relapse-inducing cells with combined properties of long-term dormancy, treatment resistance, and stemness. Single-cell and bulk expression profiling revealed their similarity to primary ALL cells isolated from pediatric and adult patients at minimal residual disease (MRD). Therapeutically adverse characteristics were reversible, as resistant, dormant cells became sensitive to treatment and started proliferating when dissociated from the in vivo environment. Our data suggest that ALL patients might profit from therapeutic strategies that release MRD cells from the niche. Overall design: Gene expression profiles from two PDX ALL Samples (ALL-199 & ALL-265) were generated for either dormant (LRC) vs. dividing (non-LRC) cells or drug treated vs. non-treated cells. For single cell analysis one mouse were analyzed for each condition."

The next day the cells were treated with 4OHT to induce senescence. 6 days later the cells were collected for total mRNA analysis. Our previous experiments had shown that these 38 genes regulate the secretome of senescent cells without affecting other senescence phenotypes such as the growth arrest. By performing RNA-seq we confirmed that knockdown of these genes affected the expression of multiple pro-inflammatory factors in senescence. More importantly, the secreted factors were differentially regulated across the different knockdown conditions indicating potential for specific manipulation of immune response genes. Overall design: 92 conditions were examined: proliferating cells (Noninduced), senescent cells (Water, Allstars), senescent cells transfected with 2 siRNAs targeting 38 different genes (Hs_GeneID_n), senescent cells transfected with positive control siRNAs (p16, p53, CEBPB, p38, p65) and additional conditions included proliferating and senescent IMR90 ER:RAS cells mock-transfected or transfected with various non-targeting siRNAs (Extras1-8) to monitor changes in gene epression independent of gene knockdown."

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP140795",56,"Using RNA sequencing to examine age-dependent skeletal muscle transcriptome response to bed rest-induced atrophy, and age independent disuse-induced insulin resistance","Short-term bed rest is used to simulate muscle disuse in humans.  In our previous reports, we found that 5d of bed rest induced a ~4% loss of skeletal muscle mass in OLD (60-79 y) but not YOUNG (18-28 y) subjects. Identifying muscle transcriptional events in response to bed rest and age-related differences will help identify therapeutic targets to offset muscle loss in vulnerable older adult populations.  Skeletal muscle dysregulation during bed rest in the old may be driven by alterations in molecules related to fibrosis, inflammation, and cell adhesion. This information may aide in the development of mechanistic-based therapies to combat muscle atrophy during short-term disuse.  Short-term muscle disuse is also characterized by skeletal muscle insulin resistance, though this response is divergent across subjects. The mechanisms regulating inactivity-induced insulin resistance between populations that are more or less susceptible to disuse-induced insulin resistance are not known, and delineated by age. High Susceptibility participants were uniquely characterized with muscle gene responses described by a decrease in pathways responsible for lipid uptake and oxidation, decreased capacity for triglyceride export (APOB), increased lipogenesis (i.e., PFKFB3, FASN), and increased amino acid export (SLC43A1). Overall design: RNA was isolated and sequenced from muscle biopsies obtained from the vastus lateralis of YOUNG (N=9) and OLD (N=18) men and women before and after five days of bed rest. Sequencing libraries (18 pM) were chemically denatured and applied to an Illumina TruSeq v3 single read flowcell using an Illumina cBot.  Hybridized molecules were clonally amplified and annealed to sequencing primers with reagents from an Illumina TruSeq SR Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (GD-401-3001).   Following transfer of the flowcell to an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument (HCS v2.0.12 and RTA v1.17.21.3), a 50 cycle single read sequence run was performed using TruSeq SBS v3 sequencing reagents (FC-401-3002). The design formula was constructed by following the section on group-specific condition effects, individuals nested within groups in the DESeq2 vignette.   The design included age + age:nested + age:time to test for differences in bed rest in old subjects, young subjects and the interaction, in this case if bed rest effects are different between the two age groups (where age is young or old, nested is patient number nested by age and time is pre- or post-bed rest).

In CRCs dormant cells are found to be highly clonogenic and resistant to chemotherapies.  We sought to understand the molecular features of dormant CRC cells to facilitate rationale identification of compounds to target both dormant and cycling tumour cells. Overall design: Six colorectal cancer cell lines (DLD1, HCT15, HT55, SW948, RKO and SW48) were labelled with the cell permeable dye CFSE and then grown in non-adherent spheroid culture for 6 days to enable identification of dormant cells that retain CFSE (LRC) and cycling cells (BULK).  LRCs and BULK populations were then FACS sorted from each cell line in quadruplicate. As a control experiment, to identify off-target effects of the CFSE dye and culture artefacts, BULK populations from DLD1 cells at d1 and d6 after seeding both with and without CFSE labelling were included in the RNAseq analysis.

Here we show that SRp55, a splicing factor regulated by the diabetes susceptibility gene GLIS3, has a major role in maintaining function and survival of human beta cells. RNA-seq analysis revealed that SRp55 regulates the splicing of genes involved in cell survival and death, insulin secretion and JNK signalling. Specifically, SRp55-mediated splicing changes modulate the function of the pro-apoptotic proteins BIM and BAX, JNK signalling and endoplasmic reticulum stress, explaining why SRp55 depletion triggers beta cell apoptosis. Furthermore, SRp55 depletion inhibits beta cell mitochondrial function, explaining the observed decrease in insulin release. These data unveil a novel layer of regulation of human beta cell function and survival, namely alternative splicing modulated by key splicing regulators such as SRp55 that may crosstalk with candidate genes for diabetes.

Glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) are a source of tumor formation and recurrence in glioblastoma multiforme, a highly aggressive brain cancer, suggesting that ion channel expression may be perturbed in this population. However, little is known about the expression and functional relevance of ion channels that may contribute to GSC malignancy. Using RNA sequencing, we assessed the enrichment of ion channels in GSC isolates and non-tumor neural cell types. We identified a unique set of GSC-enriched ion channels using differential expression analysis that stratify by molecular subtype and are associated with distinct gene mutation signatures. In support of potential clinical relevance, expression of selected GSC-enriched ion channels evaluated in human glioblastoma databases of The Cancer Genome Atlas and Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project correlated with patient survival times. Finally, genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of individual or classes of GSC-enriched ion channels constrained growth of GSCs compared to normal neural stem cells. This first-in-kind global examination characterizes ion channels enriched in GSCs and explores their potential clinical relevance to glioblastoma molecular subtypes, gene mutations, survival outcomes, regional tumor expression, and experimental responses to loss-of-function. Together, the data support the potential biological and therapeutic impact of ion channels on GSC malignancy and provide strong rationale for further examination of their mechanistic and therapeutic importance.

However, relevant preclinical models that recapitulate these tumor microenvironment are lacking and how the differences in the microenvironment affect cancer cell behavior are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of tumor microenvironment on cancer cells behavior and therapeutic response. METHODS: Previously established two behaviorally distinct patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTX) models (moderate: PAC006 and poorly differentiated: PAC010) were re-implanted in Nude mice. Tumor volume, histology, immuno-histochemical, RNA sequencing and other molecular technique were used to characterize the models and study the effect of two classes of drugs (Gemcitabine (nucleoside analog) and Acriflavine (HIF-inhibitor)). RESULTS: -Models- The models recapitulated the histologic, genetic and biological characteristics of the corresponding primary tumors except the replacement of human stroma with mice stroma. The growth-rate of the tumors was significantly different between both models (cell doubling time, PAC006: 5.8 days vs PAC010: 3.6 days, p=0.005). Rapid tumor growth was associated with poor tumor differentiation that may reflect the ability of our PDTX models to mimic the cellular and non-cellular features of the parental tumor. At the molecular level, the poorly differentiated model showed increased Ki-67 staining and higher phosphorylation levels of AKT, ERK and NF-kB65. In addition, RT-qPCR, NGS and protein expression showed significant up-regulation of mesenchymal markers in tumor cells (e.g. VIM, SNAI2, HIF1A and TGF-ß1) and growth factors and cytokines in mice stroma. RNA sequencing analysis from tumor cells and stroma demonstrated activation of pathways related to tumor progression and aggressiveness in PAC010 compared to PAC006. Gemcitabine treatment resulted in a shrinking of the tumor and reduction of proliferation in both models. Interestingly, gemcitabine treatment also significantly enhanced the expression of mesenchymal marker (e.g. VIM, SNAI2, SPARC, ZEB1), particularly in the well-moderately differentiated tumor model. Acriflavine had little effect on tumor growth in both models. Overall design: Tumor implantation, treatment procedure, growth and sample collection: Stored tumor tissue was implanted into a first group of 4 mice, after establishment of growth tumor tissue in these mice the tumors were used for expansion in a new generation of mice. After the tumor reach a volume of 100-200 mm3, these mice were randomly divided into three groups with eight mice in each group; A) the control group that was treated with vehicle (0.9% NaCl) and the experimental groups was treated intraperitoneally for up to 28 days with B) Gemcitabine (50 mg/kg) injected twice a week. C) Acriflavine: schedule four doses of acriflavine were injected daily with a fixed dose of 5 mg/kg Monday to Thursday and single dose of 10 mg/kg on Friday for the weekend. Prior to actual study, a toxicity study for ACF was carried out. The body weight and tumor size were measured thrice a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday). The tumor volume was calculated using the formula: Tumor length (mm) x Tumor width (mm) x Tumor depth (mm) x (3.14/6) = Tumor volume (mm³).

Senescent cells display a repressive chromatin configuration thought to stably silence proliferation-promoting genes, while at the same time activate an unusual form of immune surveillance involving a secretory program referred to as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Here we demonstrate that senescence also involves a global remodeling of the enhancer landscape with recruitment of the chromatin reader BRD4 to newly activated super-enhancers adjacent to key SASP genes. Transcriptional profiling and functional studies indicate that BRD4 is required for the SASP and downstream paracrine signaling. Consequently, BRD4 inhibition disrupts immune cell-mediated targeting and elimination of premalignant senescent cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results identify a critical role for BRD4-bound super-enhancers in senescence immune surveillance and in the proper execution of a tumor-suppressive program.

To interrogate axon-specific processes we developed Axon-seq, a refined method incorporating microfluidic devices and stringent bioinformatic quality controls. Axon-seq demonstrates improved sensitivity and accuracy in whole-transcriptome sequencing of axons compared to previously published studies. Importantly, we show that axon transcriptomes are distinct from those of somas, displaying fewer detected genes and no contaminating astrocytic markers. We identified >5,000 transcripts in stem cell-derived spinal motor axons required for local oxidative energy production and ribosome generation. Axons contained unique transcription factor mRNAs, e.g. Ybx1, with implications for local axonal functions. Cross-comparison with existing mouse motor axon datasets, as well as our own human motor axon data identified a common axon transcriptome. As motor axons degenerate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we investigated their response to the disease-causing SOD1G93A mutation, identifying 121 ALS-dysregulated transcripts. Several of these are implicated in axonal and dendritic outgrowth, including Nrp1, Dbn1, and Nek1, a known ALS-causing gene. In conclusion, Axon-seq proves a robust and improved method for RNA-seq of axons, furthers our understanding of peripheral axon biology, and identifies novel therapeutic targets to maintain neural connectivity in disease. Overall design: A total of 118 samples were analyzed here. Of these, 32 are microfluidic cell culture samples derived from mouse embryonic stem cells differentiated into motor neurons, where axons and somas were separated for RNA isolation. This was performed for 2 cell lines (control and SOD1G93A), resulting in the following 4 groups: control somas (n=13), control axons (n=5), SOD1G93A somas (n=10) and SOD1G93A axons (n=4).

Obesity is tightly associated with T2D, making it challenging to isolate specific effects attributed to the disease alone. By using an in vitro myocyte model system we were able to isolate the inherent properties retained in myocytes originating from donor muscle precursor cells, without being confounded by varying extracellular factors present in the in vivo environment of the donor. We generated and characterized transcriptional profiles of myocytes from 24 human subjects, using a factorial design with two levels each of the factors T2D (healthy or diseased) and obesity (non-obese or obese), and determined the influence of each specific factor on genome-wide transcription. We identified a striking similarity of the transcriptional profiles associated independently with T2D or obesity. Obesity thus presents an inherent phenotype in skeletal myocytes, similar to that induced by T2D. Through bioinformatics analysis we found a candidate epigenetic mechanism, H3K27me3 histone methylation, mediating the observed transcriptional signatures. Functional characterization of the expression profiles revealed dysregulated myogenesis and down-regulated muscle function in connection with T2D and obesity, as well as up-regulation of genes involved in inflammation and the extracellular matrix. Further on, we identified a metabolite subnetwork involved in sphingolipid metabolism and affected by transcriptional up-regulation in T2D. Collectively, these findings pinpoint transcriptional changes that are hard-wired in skeletal myocytes in connection with both obesity and T2D. Overall design: Isolated skeletal muscle precursor cells from 24 males and females (6 normal glucose tolerant, 6 obese, 6 type 2 diabetic, and 6 obese and type 2 diabetic) were differentiated in vitro and stimulated with insulin.

Viral cure cannot fully eliminate the risk of disease progression and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in advanced liver disease. The mechanisms for establishment of infection, liver disease progression and hepatocarcinogenesis are only partially understood. To address these questions, we probed the functional proteogenomic architecture of HCV infection within a hepatocyte-model. Methods: Time-resolved HCV infection of hepatocyte-like cells was analyzed by RNA sequencing, proteomics, metabolomics, and leveraged by integrative genomic analyses. Using differential expression, gene set enrichment analyses, and protein-protein interaction mapping we identified pathways relevant for liver disease pathogenesis that we validated in livers of 216 cirrhotic patients with HCV. Results: We uncovered marked changes in the protein expression of gene sets involved in innate immunity, metabolism and hepatocarcinogenesis. In infected cells, HCV enhances glucose metabolism and creates a Warburg-like shift of the lactate flux. HCV infection impaired the formation of peroxisomes -organelles required for long-chain fatty acid oxidation- causing intracellular fatty acid accumulation, which is a hallmark of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Ex vivo studies confirmed perturbed peroxisomes and revealed an association of hepatic catalase expression with clinical outcomes and phenotypes in HCV-associated cirrhosis, NAFLD and HCC cohorts. Conclusion: Our integrative analyses uncover how HCV perturbs the hepatocyte cell circuits to drive chronic liver disease and hepatocarcinogenesis. This proteogenomic atlas of HCV infection provides a model for the discovery of novel drivers for viral- and non-viral induced liver disease. Overall design: mRNA profiles of either mock or HCV-infected Huh7.5.1dif cells, performed in triplicates and collected every day between days 0 and 10 post infection. HCV infection reached plateau at day 7 post infection (pi). After day 7 pi unspecific effects cannot be excluded."

Bioinformatic analysis identified 37 miRNAs and 1449 genes that are differentially expressed specifically in keloid-prone individuals during wound healing. Pathway enrichment analysis was undertaken in the RNA-Seq data and identified NOTCH signaling, MAPK signaling, and Toll-like receptor pathways to be altered in keloid-prone individuals after wounding. In addition, dysregulation of DNA repair, p53 signalling and metabolic pathways (RNA, protein, fructose, mannose and glycerophospholipid metabolism) was highlighted during keloid formation. Gene association network analysis demonstrated divergent average expression profiles of cytokine signaling genes, as well as lipid metabolism genes between keloid-prone and healthy individuals during wound healing.

We compared the transcriptomes of patient-derived tumors regressing on MAPKi therapy against MAPKi-induced temporal transcriptomic states in human melanoma cell lines or murine melanoma in immune-competent mice. Despite heterogeneous dynamics of clinical tumor regression, residual tumors displayed highly recurrent transcriptomic alterations and enriched processes, which were also observed in MAPKi-selected cell lines (implying tumor cell-intrinsic reprogramming) or in bulk mouse tumors (and the CD45-negative or -positive fractions,, implying tumor cell-intrinsic or stromal/immune alterations, respectively). Tumor cell-intrinsic reprogramming attenuated MAPK-dependency, while enhancing mesenchymal, angiogenic and IFN-inflammatory features and growth/survival dependence on multi-RTKs and PD-L2. In the immune compartment, PD-L2 upregulation in CD11c+ immunocytes drove the loss of T-cell inflammation and promoted BRAFi resistance. Thus, residual melanoma early on MAPKi therapy already displays potentially exploitable adaptive transcriptomic, epigenomic, immune-regulomic alterations.

One hundred base pair paired-end sequencing was run on the HiSeq 2000. TopHat (v2.0.4) was used to enforce strand specificity and to align the sequencing reads to known transcripts of the Ensembl Build GRCh37.67. FeatureCounts (v1.4.4) was used to count the total number of reads overlapping each gene using the default settings, with paired-end and reverse-stranded counting specified using the Ensembl Build GRCh37.67 gtf file. These counts were merged from both reads of the paired-end sequencing and normalized by library size and coding gene length to form Reads Per Kilobase of Gene per Million mapped reads (RPKM) values. The influence of diagnosis on expression was analyzed with linear regression transcriptome-wide and further evaluated using a gene set analysis. Results: There was no significant diagnosis effect on any of the individual genes but expression of the gene set of HNMT, HRH1, HRH2, and HRH3 was significantly altered. Conclusions: Our study represents the first specific analysis of the expression of histamine related genes in ASD and suggests that these genes may collectively be dysregulated. Overall design: Comparison of gene expression of 13 ASD cases and 39 matched controls."

Here we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to profile the gene expression landscapes of ~4,000 cardiac cells from human embryos and identified four major types of cells: cardiomyocytes (CMs), cardiac fibroblasts, endothelial cells (EC) and valvar interstitial cells (VICs). During heart development, atrial and ventricular CMs acquired distinct features early in development. Furthermore, both CMs and fibroblasts show stepwise changes in gene expression. As development proceeds, VICs might be involved in the remodeling phase, and ECs display location-specific characteristics. Finally, we compared gene expression profiles between human and mouse and identified a serial of unique features of human heart development. Our study lays the groundwork for elucidating the mechanisms of in vivo human cardiac development and provides potential clues to understand cardiac regeneration.

The hepatic molecular events underlying the development of NAFLD and transition to NASH are poorly understood. The present study aimed to determine hepatic transcriptome dynamics in patients with NAFL or NASH compared to healthy normal-weight and obese individuals. RNA sequencing and quantitative histomorphometry of liver fat, inflammation and fibrosis was performed on liver biopsies obtained from healthy normal weight (n=14) and obese (n=12) individuals, NAFL (n=15) and NASH (n=16) patients. Normal weight and obese subjects showed normal liver histology and comparable gene expression profiles. Liver transcriptome signatures were largely overlapping in NAFL and NASH patients, however, clearly separated from healthy normal-weight and obese controls. Most marked pathway perturbations identified in both NAFL and NASH were associated with markers of lipid metabolism, immunomodulation, extracellular matrix remodeling and cell cycle control. Interestingly, NASH patients with positive Sonic hedgehog hepatocyte staining showed distinct transcriptome and histomorphometric changes compared to NAFL. In conclusion, application of immunohistochemical markers of hepatocyte injury may serve as a more objective tool for distinguishing NASH from NAFL, facilitating improved resolution of hepatic molecular changes associated with progression of NAFLD. Overall design: Liver biopsies from healthy, obese, NAFLD and NASH subjects"

Here we used molecular data to quantify the contribution of cis-acting genetic effects at each major stage of gene regulation from chromatin to proteins, within a population sample of Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). We performed 4sU metabolic labeled transcripts in 65 YRI LCLs to identify genetic variants that affect transcription rates. As expected, we found an important contribution of genetic variation via chromatin, contributing ~65% of eQTLs (expression Quantitative Trait Loci). The remaining eQTLs, which are not asso- ciated with chromatin-level variation, are highly enriched in transcribed regions, and hence may affect expression through co- or post-transcriptional processes. Overall design: International HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from YRI (Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria); We adapted the 4sU labelling method from (PMID 21516085). Briefly, cell cultures were grown to log phase in volumes sufficient to yield about 300 ng of 4sU-labeled RNA. Cells were incubated with 4sU for the required length of time (0, 30, or 60 minutes), then washed, pelleted, and frozen. Total RNA was extracted, and 4sU-labeled RNA was separated from total RNA using a bead-based biotin-streptavidin purification protocol.

We find that Mn dose showed widespread effects in abundance of protein coding genes for metabolism of reactive oxygen species, energy sensing, glycolysis, protein homeostasis including the unfolded protein response and transcriptional regulation. Adaptive responses at physiological Mn concentration-10 µM Mn for 5 h, a concentration that did not result in cell death after 24 h increased abundance of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the protein secretion pathway that function in protein trafficking and cellular homeostasis.These include BET1 (Golgi vesicular membrane trafficking protein), ADAM10 (ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10) and ARFGAP3 (ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase activating protein 3). In contrast, 5 h exposure to 100 µM Mn, a concentration that caused cell death after 24 h, increased abundance of DEGs for components of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway. In conclusion, this study provides a framework  for Mn dose dependent exposure in a human in vitro cell culture model and provides a testable hypothesis for in vivo studies. Importantly, the transcriptome responses at toxic Mn dose demonstrated patterns observed with neurological diseases and suggest that differential functions of the secretory pathway and mitochondria could provide a basis to improve detection and management of adverse environmental and occupational Mn exposures. Overall design: Examination of transcriptomic responses to Mn dose (0,1,5,10,50,100 µM MnCl2 for 5 h) in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with three biological replicates per Mn treatment using Illumina HiSeq 2500."

While their plasticity to become ILC1s, the innate counterparts of type 1 helper T cells, has been described previously, we report that they can differentiate into cytotoxic lymphocytes with many characteristics of early differentiated natural killer (NK) cells. This transition is promoted by the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-15, and correlates with expression of the master transcription factor of cytotoxicity eomesodermin (Eomes). As revealed by transcriptome analysis and flow cytometric profiling, differentiated ILC3s express CD94, NKG2A, NKG2C, CD56 and CD16 among other NK cell receptors, and possess all components of the cytotoxic machinery. These characteristics allow them to recognize and kill leukemic cells. Therefore, ILC3s can be harnessed for cytotoxic responses via differentiation under the influence of proinflammatory cytokines. Overall design: Expression profiling (RNA-Seq) of NKp44+ innate lymphoid cells (ILC) derived from pediatric tonsils and spleens of NOD SCID-/-?c-/- mice reconstituted with human hematopoietic progenitor cells.

Recently, a highly invasive multi-drug resistant S. Typhimurium of a distinct multilocus sequence type (MLST), ST313, has emerged across sub-Saharan Africa as a major cause of lethal bacteraemia in children and immunosuppressed adults. Encounters between dendritic cells (DCs) and invading bacteria determine the course of infection but whether or how ST313 might usurp DC mediated defence has not been reported. Here we utilised fluorescently labelled invasive and non-invasive strains of Salmonella combined with single-cell RNA sequencing to study the transcriptomes of individual infected and bystander DCs. The transcriptomes displayed a repertoire of cell instrinsic and extrinsic innate response states that differed between invasive and non-invasive strains. Gene expression heterogeneity was increased in DCs challenged with invasive Salmonella. DCs exposed but not harbouring invasive Salmonella exhibited a hyper-activated profile that likely facilitates trafficking of infected cells and dissemination of internalised intact bacteria. In contrast, invasive Salmonella containing DCs demonstrate reprogramming of trafficking genes required to avoid autophagic destruction.  Furthermore, these cells displayed differential expression of tolerogenic IL10 and MARCH1 enabling CD83 mediated adaptive immune evasion. Altogether our data illustrate pathogen cell-to cell variability directed by a Salmonella invasive strain highlighting potential mechanisms of host adaption with implications for dissemination in vivo.

We engineered a DCX-Citrine/Y hESC line to sort and characterize progenitor and neuron transcriptomics separately at both the subpopulation and single cell level. The cells generated in vitro were compared to similar populations present in human fetal brain samples by mapping gene expression data from human fetal cells onto the principal component analysis (PCA) space of in vitro-derived populations. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to determine the discreet cell types present at D24, D54, D100 and D125 of culture, and describe the gene expression changes that occur in progenitor and neuron populations over time. Immature lateral ganglionic eminence and medial ganglionic eminence cells are present at early timepoints, along with MGE-like and dorsal pallium-like neuronal progenitors.

However, because humans can absorb Neu5Gc which deposits at low levels on endothelial cells (EC), activation of endothelium by anti-Neu5Gc has been raised. Understanding whether this interaction contributes to EC normal biology or may induce a potentially detrimental EC activation is crucial, particularly in patients  developing  elicited anti-Neu5Gc following introduction of animal derived molecules or bio-devices. Ten EC lines were cultured with immune-affinity purified anti-Neu5Gc from normal sera (diet induced) or sera harvested following  rabbit-IgG infusion (elicited) anti-Neu5Gc. After a 4h-incubation of Neu5Gc loaded ECs at levels close to those of freshly harvested ECs, ECs were stimulated with both anti-Neu5Gc types and with or without human complement. Anti-Neu5Gc induce a differential expression (DE) of 967 out of expressed 12,208 genes, with transcript accumulation in 93%. Most DE transcripts are shared following activation by pre-existing or elicited anti-Neu5Gc. Compared to ATG pre-existing antibodies, elicited anti-Neu5Gc down-regulated 66 genes, involving master genes such as IL8, ICAM1, MAPKINASES or  NFKb1. Furthermore, addition of elicited anti-Neu5Gc to non-heat inactivated sera down-regulated most of the transcripts mobilized by serum alone, including key transcripts involved in apoptosis, fitting with no  increase in apoptotic cells. Altogether, the RNA profiling following culture of human ECs and anti-Neu5Gc suggests that pre-existing anti-Neu5Gc contribute to normal human EC homeostasis rather than to an inflammatory oriented transcriptome. Elicited anti-Neu5Gc do not also skew EC transcriptome toward inflammation either, but trigger the release cytokines or chemokines in culture supernatants. Overall design: Ten endothelial cell (EC) lines were cultured with immune-affinity purified anti-Neu5Gc from normal sera (diet induced) or sera harvested following  rabbit-IgG infusion (elicited) anti-Neu5Gc. After a 4h-incubation of Neu5Gc loaded ECs at levels close to those of freshly harvested ECs, ECs were stimulated with both anti-Neu5Gc types and with or without human complement.

Cell heterogeneity also is found in pluripotent stem cells such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The implication and mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity remain to be defined. We have optimized a robust method that can simultaneously measure telomere length coupled with RNA-sequencing analysis (scT&R-seq) in the same human ES cell. Using this method, we show that telomere length varies with pluripotency state. Long telomere hESCs highly express TERF1/TRF1 as well as ZFP42/REX1, PRDM14 and NANOG for naïve pluripotency, in contrast to short telomere hESCs. hESCs express high telomerase activity as expected, and ubiquitously express NOP10 and DKC1, stabilizing components of telomerase complexes, regardless of telomere lengths. Moreover, new candidate genes such as MELK, MSH6 and UBQLN1 cluster with long telomeres and pluripotency network. Notably, short telomere hESCs exhibit higher oxidative phosphorylation primed for lineage differentiation, whereas long telomere hESCs show elevated glycolysis, another key feature for naïve pluripotency. Our data further suggest that telomere length is implicated in metabolism activity and pluripotency state of hESCs. Single cell analysis of telomere and RNA-sequencing can be exploited to further understand the molecular mechanisms of telomere heterogeneity. Overall design: By combining the methods to amplify the telomere specific sequences and mRNA separately, 121 single hESCs were randomly selected for full-length RNA-seq using Smart-seq2."

Clinical manipulation of Tregs is of great interest, and first- in-man trials of Treg transfer achieved promising outcomes. Yet, the mechanisms governing induced Treg (iTreg) differentiation and the regulation of FOXP3 are incompletely understood. To gain a comprehensive and unbiased molecular understanding of FOXP3 induction, we performed time-series RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and proteomics profiling on the same samples during human iTreg differentiation. To enable the broad analysis of universal FOXP3-inducing pathways, we used five differentiation protocols in parallel. Integrative analysis of the transcriptome and proteome confirmed involvement of specific molecular processes, as well as overlap of a novel iTreg subnetwork with known Treg regulators and autoimmunity-associated genes. Importantly, we propose 37 novel molecules putatively involved in iTreg differentiation. Their relevance was validated by: a targeted shRNA screen confirming a functional role in FOXP3 induction; discriminant analyses classifying iTregs accordingly; and comparable expression in an independent novel iTreg RNA-Seq data set. The data generated by this novel approach facilitate understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying iTreg generation as well as the concomitant changes in the transcriptome and proteome. Our results provide a reference map exploitable for future discovery of markers and drug candidates governing control of Tregs, which has important implications for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Overall design: We performed a time-course experiment including six time points and four iTreg differentiation conditions. We included also a control time series and unstimulated nTregs. Three biological replicates were included. The total sample count is 81. In detail, human naïve CD4+ T cells were magnetically negatively isolated from peripheral blood.

These effects were proposed to be mediated in a virus-specific manner, through dysregulated methylation of viral RNA. We use RNA-seq to systematically follow differences in gene expression in cells depleted of m6A machinery, compared to control cells, following human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. We show that following viral infection or stimulation of cells with an inactivated virus, depletion of the m6A 'writer' protein METTL3  or 'reader' protein YTHDF2 leads to a dramatic increase in the induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which constitutes the first line of antiviral defense. Consequently, propagation of different viruses is markedly suppressed in an interferon (IFN)-signaling dependent manner. Furthermore, we used m6A-immunoprecipitation, followed by RNA-seq, to map m6A sites on human and HCMV transcripts, and found that the mRNA of IFNß, the central cytokine that drives the type I IFN response, is m6A modified, and is stabilized upon repression of METTL3 and YTHDF2.

Despite early success of BETi in a range of malignancies, the development of drug resistance may limit their clinical application. We evaluated the mechanisms of BETi resistance in uveal melanoma (UM), a disease with little treatment options, using two approaches: a high-throughput combinatorial drug screen with the clinical BET inhibitor PLX51107, and RNA sequencing of BETi-resistant cells. We found that the NF-kB inhibitors synergistically sensitized UM cells to PLX51107 treatment. Furthermore, genes involved in NF-kB signaling were upregulated in BETi-resistant cells and the transcription factor CEBPD contributed to the mechanism of resistance. These findings suggest that inhibitors of NF-kB signaling may improve the efficacy of BET inhibition in patients with advanced UM. Overall design: We developed 4 BETi-resistant uveal and 1 BETi-resistant cutaneous melanoma cell lines by exposing chronically the cells to increasing doses of PLX51107(0.05-2 µM) for eight weeks.

High-risk neuroblastoma patients receive myeloablative chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem-cell transplant followed by adjuvant retinoid differentiation treatment. However, the overall survival remains low; hence, there is an urgent need for alternative therapeutic approaches. One feature of high-risk neuroblastoma is the high level of DNA methylation of putative tumor suppressors. Combining the reversibility of DNA methylation with the differentiation-promoting activity of retinoic acid (RA) could provide an alternative strategy to treat high-risk neuroblastoma. Here we show that treatment with the DNA demethylating drug 5-Aza-deoxycytidine (AZA) restores high-risk neuroblastoma sensitivity to RA. Combined systemic distribution of AZA and RA impedes tumor growth and prolongs survival. Genomewide analysis of treated tumors reveals that this combined treatment rapidly induces a HIF2a-associated hypoxia-like transcriptional response followed by an increase in neuronal gene expression and a decrease in cell-cycle gene expression. A small-molecule inhibitor of HIF2a activity diminishes the tumor response to AZA+RA treatment, indicating that the increase in HIF2a levels is a key component in tumor response to AZA+RA. The link between increased HIF2a levels and inhibited tumor growth is reflected in large neuroblastoma patient datasets. Therein, high levels of HIF2a, but not HIF1a, significantly correlate with expression of neuronal differentiation genes and better prognosis but negatively correlate with key features of high-risk tumors, such as MYCN amplification. Thus, contrary to previous studies, our findings indicate an unanticipated tumor-suppressive role for HIF2a in neuroblastoma. Overall design: 68 samples, 3-5 samples per group, 4st treatment molecules; Ctrl (DMSO), Retinoic acid (RA), 5-Aza-deoxycytidine (AZA) and RA+AZA. 2E6 cells were injected, treatment start day 8 and tumors were collected at end point (EP; 1000 m3), day 10 or day 14."

Their role in the development of breast cancer is not well understood but insight into the critical events at this early stage will improve efforts in breast cancer detection and prevention. These microscopic lesions are technically difficult to study so very little is known about their molecular alterations.  To characterize the transcriptional changes of early breast neoplasia, we sequenced 3''- end enriched RNAseq libraries from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue of early neoplasia samples and matched normal breast and carcinoma samples from 25 patients. We find that gene  expression patterns within early neoplasias are distinct from both normal and breast cancer patterns and identify a pattern of pro-oncogenic changes, including elevated transcription of ERBB2, FOXA1, and GATA3 at this early stage. We validate these findings on a second independent gene expression profile data set generated by whole transcriptome sequencing. Measurements of protein expression by immunohistochemistry on an independent set of early neoplasias confirms that ER pathway regulators FOXA1 and GATA3, as well as ER itself, are consistently upregulated at this early stage. The early neoplasia samples also demonstrate coordinated changes in long non-coding RNA expression and microenvironment stromal gene expression patterns.  This study is the first examination of global gene expression in early breast neoplasia, and the genes identified here represent candidate participants in the earliest molecular events in the development of breast cancer. Overall design: 3SEQ was performed on 72 FFPE human breast samples from 25 patients:  24 normal, 25 early neoplasia, 9 carcinoma in situ, and 14 invasive cancer"

Children with severe asthma have lower levels of vitamin D than children with moderate asthma, and among children with severe asthma, airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass is inversely related to vitamin D levels. Beta2 agonists are a common asthma medication that act partly by targetting the ASM. We used RNA-Seq to characterize the human ASM transcriptome of fatal and asthma vs. contols at baseline and under two treatment conditions. Methods: The Illumina TruSeq assay was used to prepare 75bp paired-end libraries for ASM cells from white donors, 6 with fatal asthma and 12 control donors under three treatment conditions: 1) no treatment; 2) treatment with a ß2-agonist (i.e. Albuterol, 1µM for 18h); 3) treatment with vitamin D 100 nM for 18h).

The Mesalamine and Reproductive Health Study (MARS) was designed to address the physiological effect of in-vivo phthalate exposure on male reproduction in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). As part of this effort, sperm RNA profiles as an effect of exposure to DBP were longitudinally assessed using a cross-over cross-back design of binary, high or background, levels of DBP. As the DBP level was altered, numerous sperm RNA elements were differentially expressed, and suggest that exposure to or removal from high DBP produces effects that require longer than one spermatogenic cycle to resolve.  In comparison, small RNAs are minimally affected by DBP exposure. While initial study medication (high or background) implicates different biological pathways, initiation on the high-DBP condition activated oxidative stress and DNA damage pathways. Using ejaculated sperm, this work provides insight into the male germline's response to phthalate exposure.

Assessing preclinical nephrotoxicity relies on animal models that are frequently insensitive, and thus, novel techniques, including human microphysiological systems, or “organs on chips,” are proposed to accelerate drug development and predict safety. Polymyxins are potent antibiotics against multidrug-resistant microorganisms; yet clinical use remains restricted because of high risk of nephrotoxicity and limited understanding of toxicological mechanisms. To mitigate risks, structural analogs of polymyxins (NAB739 and NAB741) are currently in clinical development. Using a microphysiological system to model human kidney proximal tubule, we exposed cells to polymyxin B (PMB) and observed significant increases of injury signals, including kidney injury molecule-1 KIM-1and a panel of injury-associated miRNAs (each P < 0.001). Surprisingly, transcriptional profiling identified cholesterol biosynthesis as the primary cellular pathway induced by PMB (P = 1.2 ×10–16), and effluent cholesterol concentrations were significantly increased after exposure (P < 0.01). Additionally, we observed no upregulation of the nuclear factor (erythroid derived-2)–like 2 pathway despite this being a common pathway upregulated in response to proximal tubule toxicants. In contrast with PMB exposure, minimal changes in gene expression, injury biomarkers, and cholesterol concentrations were observed in response to NAB739 and NAB741. Our findings demonstrate the preclinical safety of NAB739 and  NAB741 and reveal cholesterol biosynthesis as the novel (to our knowledge) pathway for PMB- induced injury. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a human-on-chip platform used  for simultaneous safety testing of new chemical entities and defining unique toxicological pathway responses of an FDA-approved molecule.

LncRNAs are less conserved, less abundant, and more tissue specific than mRNAs, implying that our understanding of lncRNA transcriptional regulation is incomplete. Here, we perform an in depth characterization of numerous factors contributing to this regulation. We find that lncRNA promoters contain fewer transcription factor binding sites than do those of mRNAs, with some notable exceptions. Surprisingly, we find that H3K9me3 –typically associated with transcriptional repression­–is enriched at active lncRNA loci. However, the most discriminant differences between lncRNAs and mRNAs involve splicing: only half of lncRNAs are efficiently spliced, which can be partially attributed to defects in lncRNA splicing signals and diminished U2AF65 binding. These attributes are conserved between humans and mice. Finally, we find that certain transcriptional properties are enriched in known, functionally characterized lncRNAs, demonstrating that our multidimensional analysis might discern lncRNAs that are likely to be functional Overall design: Examination of RNA abundance in two cell lines (K562 and Hues9) and 5 time points after actinomycin D treatment.

Although SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC (SKM) can be substituted by their respective family members, OCT4 is considered to not be interchangeable with any octamer-binding POU proteins. Through a screening with 102 candidate genes, here we have identified that the POU protein OCT6 (also known as SCIP, TST-1, and POU3F1), in conjunction with SKM, is capable of functionally replacing OCT4 and inducing pluripotency. OCT6-mediated reprogramming works with any human cell type, but not with mouse cells. The reprogramming process involving OCT6 is relatively inefficient and slow. This is mainly due to either inefficient formation of OCT6-SOX2 heterodimers onto canonical SOX-OCT sites or lower transactivation activity of OCT6. We demonstrate that modulating either the DNA-binding propensity or the transactivation activity of OCT6 enhances iPSC generation to the efficiency of OCT4. These results thus provide the first evidence that a POU factor other than OCT4 can induce human pluripotency.

The goal of this study is to characterize functions of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) specific CD8+ T cell clones using single cell RNAseq Methods: PBMCs from Mtb exposed patients were stimulated ex vivo with Mtb lysate for 12 hours. Activated CD8+ T cells were selected and single cell sorted based on the upregulation of activation markers, including CD154 and CD137. Results: Using an optimized Smart-seq2 protocol, we could successfully combine TCR sequencing with transcriptome sequencing on single T cell. TCR sequence analysis allows us to preferentially identify and select expanded conventional CD8+ T cells as well as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. In summary, we analyzed 921 single cells with 2,500-3000 detected genes for each cell. The iNKT and MAIT cells have a nearly superimposable transcriptional pattern, indicating that they are variations of the same cell type, and differ considerably from conventional CD8+ T cells. While there are no distinct gene expression differences between clonally expanded versus unique iNKT or MAIT cells, highly expanded conventional CD8+ T cells downregulate the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor alpha (IL2RA, or CD25) protein and show signs of senescence. This suggests inherent limits to clonal expansion that act to diversify the T cell response repertoire. Conclusions: we combine targeted TCR sequencing with a sensitive RNA-seq protocol that yields both paired TCR sequences and extensive transcriptional information on single T cells. This enables the selection of rare, clonal and specific T cell subtypes, enabling analysis of their transcriptomes. Our targeted approach allowed us to efficiently and economically select clonal cells with a sensitive clone size dynamic range. And by using a short ex vivo stimulation (12~24 hours) to identify pathogen-responsive T cells, we could circumvent long-term ex vivo culture artifacts. By leveraging single cell analysis of clonal T cells in additional contexts we may improve our understanding of immune system responses to diseases such as cancer, additional infections, as well as aid in vaccine development.

We used polyA+ granulocyte RNA-seq from 10 healthy individuals to define granulocyte lncRNA transcriptome, which was not available before. We annotated 6,249 lncRNA transcripts forming 1,591 lncRNA loci, contributing 268 novel loci to the human genome annotation. We show that focusing on granulocytes allows identification of less well expressed, less efficiently spliced and more granulocyte specific lncRNAs. We used Ribosomal depleted granulocyte RNA-seq from 7 healthy individuals sampled in 3 replicates to estimate reproducibility and variability of lncRNA expression and found that though being as well reproducible between replicates, lncRNAs are significantly more variable in their expression than mRNAs. We confirmed this finding in publicly available Geuvadis lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) RNA-seq dataset from 462 individuals and also used this dataset to show that the number of identified lncRNA increases with the number of donors analyzed. Overall, we showed that high variability of lncRNAs is an important feature that distinguishes them from mRNAs and influences their identification strategy, making it necessary to include as many individuals as possible into the identification effort for every given cell type in order to comprehensively annotate all the lncRNAs in the human genome."

Here we report single cell transcriptomes of CD49f+ HSCs as well as those of CD49f+ Subset1 (CD19- CD38- CD45RA- CD90+ CD49f+ CD34lo CLEC9Ahi, Myelo-erythroid-skewed in vitro but Lymphoid-competent) and CD49f+ Subset2 cells (CD19- CD38- CD45RA- CD90+ CD49f+ CD34hi CLEC9Alo, Myelo-Lymphoid competent but Erythroid-deficient). We also report bulk transcriptomes of pools of 20 cells from HSC/MPP Subset1 (CD19- CD38- CD45RA- CD34lo CLEC9Ahi) and HSC/MPP Subset2 (CD19- CD38- CD45RA- CD34hi CLEC9Alo). Altogether these data show a diffuse transcriptional landscape of the CD49f+ HSC compartment, which is polarised along an axis that separates Myelo-Erythroid and Myelo-Lymphoid lineage-priming. Consistently with their differentiation capacity in vitro, CD49f+ Subset1 cells cluster at the Myelo-Erythroid end of the landscape, while CD49f+ Subset2 cells cluster at the Myelo-Lymphoid end. In addtion, these lineage-priming signatures were found to be more marked in HSC/MPP Subset1 and HSC/MPP Subset2, than in the equivalent CD49f+ subsets. In conclusion, 49f+ Subset1 and 49f+ Subset2 populations have activated distinct transcriptional lineage-priming programmes corresponding to the phenotypic lineage-skewing observed in vitro, that then become reinforced within the broader HSC/MPP pool. Altogether our data shows that lineage-priming and lineage-restriction programmes are initially established within the CD49f+ HSC subset in humans.

Several oncogenes, including the 'T-cell leukemia homeobox 1' TLX1 (HOX11) transcription factor, have been identified as early driver events that cooperate with other genetic aberrations in leukemic transformation of progenitor T-cells. The TLX1 controlled transcriptome in T-ALL has been investigated extensively in the past in terms of protein-coding genes, but remains unexplored thus far at the level of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), the latter renown as well-established versatile and key players implicated in various cancer hallmarks. In this study, we present the first extensive analysis of the TLX1 regulated transcriptome focusing on lncRNA expression patterns. We present an integrative analysis of polyA and total RNA sequencing of ALL-SIL lymphoblasts with perturbed TLX1 expression and a primary T-ALL patient cohort (including 5 TLX1+ and 12 TLX3+ cases). We expanded our initially presented dataset of TLX1 and H3K27ac ChIP data in ALL-SIL cells (Durinck et al., Leukemia, 2015) with H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and ATAC-seq data to accurately define (super-) enhancer marked lncRNAs and assigned potential functional annotations to candidate TLX1-controlled lncRNAs through an in silico guilt-by-association approach.

By systematic mapping of chromatin-associated RNAs (caRNAs) and their respective genomic interaction loci, we obtained genome-wide RNA-DNA interaction maps from two non-cancerous cell types. The gene pairs involved in RNA-DNA interactions in these normal cells exhibited strong overlap with those with cancer-derived fusion transcripts. These data suggest an RNA-poise model, where the spatial proximity of one gene's transcripts and the other gene's genomic sequence poises for the creation of fusion transcripts. We validated this model with 96 additional lung cancer samples.

Here, we investigated the transcriptomic and immunophenotypic profiles of metastatic melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1 alone or combined anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy. Effector T-cells are essential for increased anti-cancer activity, favouring better survival outcomes in patients treated with anti-PD-1 monotherapy. In contrast, response to combined anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy relied upon memory cytotoxic and helper T-cell populations. Patients with resistance to immune checkpoint blockade exploited the metabolic and hypoxia-mediated pathways to alter tumour microenvironment causing impairment of T-cell trafficking and function. Our findings provide a strong rationale for stratifying patients based on molecular profiles that determine response and resistance to anti-PD1 alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy."

Methods: Here we analyzed the relationship between fecal microbiota and blood profiles of indigenous Malaysians, referred to locally as Orang Asli, in comparison to urban participants from the capital city of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur. Results: We found that helminth infections had a larger effect on gut microbial composition than did dietary intake or blood profiles. Trichuris trichiura infection intensity also had the strongest association with blood transcriptional profiles. By characterizing paired longitudinal samples collected before and after deworming treatment, we determined that changes in serum zinc and iron levels among the Orang Asli were driven by changes in helminth infection status, independent of dietary metal intake. Serum zinc and iron levels were associated with changes in the abundance of several microbial taxa. Conclusions: There is considerable interplay between helminths, micronutrients and the microbiota on the regulation of immune responses in humans.

Examining Illumina HiSeq, Life Technologies SOLiD and Roche 454 platforms at multiple laboratory sites using reference RNA samples with built-in controls, we assess RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) performance for sequence discovery and differential expression profiling and compare it to microarray and quantitative PCR (qPCR) data using complementary metrics. At all sequencing depths, we discover unannotated exon-exon junctions, with >80% validated by qPCR. We find that measurements of relative expression are accurate and reproducible across sites and platforms if specific filters are used. In contrast, RNA-seq and microarrays do not provide accurate absolute measurements, and gene-specific biases are observed, for these and qPCR. Measurement performance depends on the platform and data analysis pipeline, and variation is large for transcriptlevel profiling. The complete SEQC data sets, comprising >100 billion reads (10Tb), provide unique resources for evaluating RNA-seq analyses for clinical and regulatory settings.

This shortage could be alleviated by using existing large archives of routinely obtained and stored Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissues. However, since these samples are partially degraded, their RNA sequencing is technically challenging. Results: In an effort to establish a reliable and practical procedure, we compared three protocols for RNA sequencing using pairs of FF and FFPE samples, both taken from the same breast tumor. In contrast to previous studies, we compared the expression profiles obtained from the two matched sample types, using the same protocol for both. Three protocols were tested on low initial amounts of RNA, as little as 100 ng, to represent the possibly limited availability of clinical samples. For two of the three protocols tested, poly(A) selection (mRNA-seq) and ribosomal-depletion, the total gene expression profiles of matched FF and FFPE pairs were highly correlated. For both protocols, differential gene expression between two FFPE samples was in agreement with their matched FF samples. Notably, although expression levels of FFPE samples by mRNA-seq were mainly represented by the 3'-end of the transcript, they yielded very similar results to those obtained by ribosomal-depletion protocol, which produces uniform coverage across the transcript. Further, focusing on clinically relevant genes, we showed that the high correlation between expression levels persists at higher resolutions. Conclusions: Using the poly(A) protocol for FFPE exhibited, unexpectedly, similar efficiency to the ribosomal-depletion protocol, with the latter requiring much higher (2-3 fold) sequencing depth to compensate for the relative low fraction of reads mapped to the transcriptome. The results indicate that standard poly(A)-based RNA sequencing of archived FFPE samples is a reliable and cost-effective alternative for measuring mRNA-seq on FF samples. Expression profiling of FFPE samples by mRNA-seq can facilitate much needed extensive retrospective clinical genomic studies. Overall design: We perform an unbiased evaluation of RNA-seq of archived tumor tissues by comparing the same library preparation methods for both FF and FFPE matched tumor samples and for small amounts of total RNA starting material. We have 3 matched FF/FFPE tumor samples with a moderate archival time of about 4-5 years (T1=T3), and additional 3 FFPE tumor samples archived for more than 10 years (T4-T6). all samples were tested with two protocols: illumina Truseq RNA after poly(A) selection (mRNA-seq); and Truseq after ribosomal depletion (RiboZero).

Gene expression changes unequivocally discriminated benign versus malignant states, and a dual epigenetic and immune signature emerged defining this transition. We discovered previously unrecognized melanoma subtypes. A high-risk primary melanoma subset was discriminated by a 122-epigenetic gene signature ('epigenetic' cluster) and TP53 family gene deregulation (TP53, TP63, and TP73). This subtype associated with poor overall survival and showed enrichment of cell cycle genes. Noncoding repetitive element transcripts (LINEs, SINEs, and ERVs) that can result in immunostimulatory signals recapitulating a state of 'viral mimicry' were significantly repressed. The high-risk subtype and its poor predictive characteristics were validated in several independent cohorts. Additionally, primary melanomas distinguished by specific immune signatures ('immune' clusters) were identified.  TP53 family of genes and genes regulating the epigenetic machinery demonstrate strong prognostic and biological relevance during progression of early disease. Gene expression profiling of RNA transcripts may be better predictors for disease course in melanoma. This study outlines the transcriptional interplay of the cancer cell's epigenome with the immune milieu with potential for future therapeutic targeting.

Using single-cell transcriptomics we observed two distinct endpoints, a primary marked by Ras and a secondary by Notch. We find that secondary senescence in vitro and in vivo requires Notch, rather than SASP alone as previously thought. Currently, primary and secondary senescent cells are not thought of as functionally distinct endpoints. A blunted SASP response and the induction of fibrillar collagens in secondary senescence compared to OIS point towards a functional diversification. Overall design: (Smart-seq2 Time course experiment): ER:RasG12V -expressing cells were induced into senescence for 7 days with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) and were isolated as single cells using FACS. Single cells that were not induced with 4-OHT were used as control. Single cells were also collected at another two time points, day 2 and day 4, before they became fully senescent on day 7.

Briefly, following perfusion with Perfusion Medium (Gibco) for 5 min, and Liver Digest Medium (Gibco) for 10 min, the liver was excised and the capsule disrupted to yield a cell suspension that was collected in Williams' E Medium supplemented with 2% FCS. Hepatocytes were purified by pelleting through a 40% (v:v) percoll gradient prior to FACS analysis.  (10x dnMAML1 experiment): We used normal diploid human female lung fibroblasts IMR90 isolated at 16 weeks of gestation for all in vitro assays (ATCC® CCL-186™). pLNCX2 ER:rasG12V-expressing IMR90 were maintained and senescence induced as described under 5% O2 conditions.

MLLr are clonal leukemogenic drivers that might initiate leukemia without additional genetic lesions. It is however challenging to reproduce MLLr-mediated iBCP-ALL in murine/humanized models and, consequently, key aspects of MLLr iBCP-ALL pathogenesis remain enigmatic. Here, we performed whole-genome, exome and RNA sequencing on an Interfant study discovery cohort of 42 iBCP-ALLs (27 MLL-AF4+, 5 MLL-AF9+ and 10 non-MLL). An independent validation cohort of 82 iBCP-ALLs (43 MLL-AF4+, 11 MLL-AF9+, and 28 non-MLL) was used for targeted DNA sequencing and qRT-PCR. We found that iBCP-ALL, irrespective of the presence/subtype of MLLr shows an extremely low frequency of somatic mutations, with the predominant leukemic clone carrying a mean of 2,5 (range:0-10) non-silent mutations. Recurrent mutations were exclusively found in KRAS and NRAS, which were more frequent in the MLL-AF4+ (42%) than in MLL-AF9+/non-MLL (19%-25%) iBCP-ALL subgroups due to common NRAS mutations found in MLL-AF4+ infants (32% vs 6%; p<0.01). These mutations were subclonal and frequently lost at relapse, despite a larger number of non-silent but not-recurrent mutations (19.5 mutations/patient, range:1-434). RNA-sequencing and qRT-PCR validation unravelled that HOXA cluster genes were only expressed in t(4;11)+ patients expressing the reciprocal fusion AF4-MLL.

As some cellular populations are very small and tissue often in scarcity, we aimed to carefully document the lowest number of cells needed to retrieve sequencable libraries. We started with capturing 120 cells and subsequently scaled down to 50 cells, 30 cells, 10 cells, 5 cells, 2 cells and finally 1 cell. By optimizing multiple steps in the procedure, including direct lysis of cells without performing RNA isolation, we developed LCM-seq that couples LCM with Smart-seq2 for robust and efficient polyA-based RNA sequencing. We applied LCM-seq to mouse and human neuron samples, and demonstrated that LCM-seq can allow us to acquire high quality RNA-seq data from mouse and human tissues to conduct various transcriptomic studies.

Most published systems vaccinology studies have utilized whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to monitor the immune response after vaccination.  Because human blood is comprised of multiple hematopoietic cell types, the potential for masking responses of under-represented cell populations is increased when analyzing whole blood or PBMC. To investigate the contribution of individual cell types to the immune response after vaccination, we established a rapid and efficient method to purify human T and B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, myeloid dendritic cells (mDC), monocytes, and neutrophils from fresh venous blood. Purified cells were fractionated and processed in a single day. RNA-Seq and quantitative shotgun proteomics were performed to determine expression profiles for each cell type prior to and after inactivated seasonal influenza vaccination. Our results show that transcriptomic and proteomic profiles generated from purified immune cells differ significantly from PBMC. Differential expression analysis for each immune cell type also shows unique transcriptomic and proteomic expression profiles as well as changing biological networks at early time points after vaccination. This cell type-specific information provides a more comprehensive approach to monitor vaccine responses.

We sequenced polyadenylated RNA-derived cDNAs from 92 psoriatic and 82 normal punch biopsies, generating an average of ~38 million single-end 80-bp reads per sample. Comparison of 42 samples* examined by both RNA-seq and microarray [GSE13355] revealed marked differences in sensitivity, with transcripts identified only by RNA-seq having much lower expression than those also identified by microarray. RNA-seq identified many more differentially expressed transcripts enriched in immune system processes.  Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed multiple modules of coordinately expressed epidermal differentiation genes, overlapping significantly with genes regulated by the long non-coding RNA TINCR, its target gene, staufen-1 (STAU1), the p63 target gene ZNF750, and its target KLF4. Other coordinately expressed modules were enriched for lymphoid and/or myeloid signature transcripts and genes induced by IL-17 in keratinocytes. Dermally-expressed genes were significantly down-regulated in psoriatic biopsies, most likely due to expansion of the epidermal compartment. These results demonstrate the power of WGCNA to elucidate gene regulatory circuits in psoriasis, and emphasize the influence of tissue architecture in both differential expression and co-expression analysis. *The list of 42 samples examined by both RNA-seq and microarray is provided in the ''MAoverlappedsamples.txt''.

Current approaches, such as in vivo animal studies, and assays of animal and human primary cell cultures, suffer from challenges related to time, cost, and applicability to human physiology. Prior research demonstrated success employing machine learning to predict developmental neurotoxicity using gene expression data collected from complex human 3D tissue models exposed to various compounds, but the complexity of 3D tissue models require extensive expertise and effort to employ. While a 3D tissue model is more physiologically accurate, by focusing only on the goal of constructing an assay of developmental neurotoxicity, we propose that a simpler 2D tissue model may prove sufficient. We thus compared the accuracy of predictive models trained on data from a 2D tissue model with those trained on prior dataset from a more complex 3D tissue model, and found the accuracy of the 2D model to be substantially better than the 3D model. Furthermore, we found that the 2D tissue model is more robust and consistent under stringent gene set selection, whereas the 3D tissue model suffers substantial degradation of accuracy. While both approaches have advantages and disadvantages, we propose that our described 2D tissue model has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for decision makers when prioritizing neurotoxicity screening.

Haematopoietic progenitors in the embryo manifest restricted differentiation potential relative to definitive haematopoietic stem cells in adult bone marrow, which support lifelong multilineage haematopoiesis. To identify regulators of embryonic haematopoiesis, we screened chromatin modifiers and identified the Polycomb group protein EZH1 as a barrier to multilineage potential from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). EZH1 was directly bound to bivalently poised, yet restricted, HSC and lymphoid genes in primitive progenitors; knockdown enabled robust generation of multilineage progenitors. Moreover, EZH1 haploinsufficiency promoted the generation of HSCs with long-term, multilineage and self-renewal potential from sites of embryonic haematopoiesis in vivo. Together, this work identifies EZH1 as a key epigenetic barrier to definitive haematopoiesis during embryonic development, and highlights the utility of chromatin modifiers as cell engineering targets to enhance blood differentiation from PSCs.

We compared gene expression between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms and control intracranial arteries. Methods—We determined expression levels with RNA sequencing. Applying a multivariate negative binomial model, we identified genes that were differentially expressed between 44 aneurysms and 16 control arteries, and between 22 ruptured and 21 unruptured aneurysms. The differential expression of 8 relevant and highly significant genes was validated using digital polymerase chain reaction. Pathway analysis was used to identify enriched pathways. We also analyzed genes with an extreme pattern of differential expression: only expressed in 1 condition without any expression in the other. Results—We found 229 differentially expressed genes in aneurysms versus controls and 1489 in ruptured versus unruptured aneurysms. The differential expression of all 8 genes selected for digital polymerase chain reaction validation was confirmed. Extracellular matrix pathways were enriched in aneurysms versus controls, whereas pathways involved in immune response and the lysosome pathway were enriched in ruptured versus unruptured aneurysms. Immunoglobulin genes were expressed in aneurysms, but showed no expression in controls. Conclusions—For rupture of intracranial aneurysms, we identified the lysosome pathway as a new pathway and found further evidence for the role of the immune response. Our results also point toward a role for immunoglobulins in the pathogenesis of aneurysms. Immune-modifying drugs are, therefore, interesting candidate treatment strategies in the prevention of aneurysm development and rupture.

Serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) lesions are the putative precursor to HGSC and identifiable in ~50% of advanced stage cases. To better understand the molecular etiology of HGSCs, we report a multi-center integrated genomic analysis of advanced stage tumors with and without STIC lesions and normal tissues. The most significant focal DNA SCNAs were shared between cases with and without STIC lesions. RNA sequence and miRNA data did not identify any clear separation between cases with and without STIC lesions.  HGSCs had molecular profiles more similar to normal fallopian tube epithelium than ovarian surface epithelium or peritoneum. The data suggest that the molecular features of HGSCs with and without associated STIC lesions are mostly shared, indicating a common biologic origin, likely to be the distal fallopian tube among all cases.

Germ cells transition to meiosis, erase genomic imprints, and reactivate the X chromosome. It is unknown if these events all appear asynchronously, and how they relate to each other. Here we combine exome sequencing of human fetal and maternal tissues with single-cell RNA-sequencing of five donors.  We reconstruct full parental haplotypes and quantify changes in parental allele specific expression, genome-wide. First we distinguish PGC, pre-meiotic, and meiotic transcriptional stages. Next we demonstrate that germ cells from various stages monoallelically express imprinted genes from e.g. the SNURF-SNRPN cluster and confirm it by methylation patterns.  Finally we show that ±30% of the PGCs, are still reactivating their inactive X chromosome and that this is related to transcriptional stage, and not to embryonic age. Altogether, we reveal the complexity and cell-to-cell heterogeneity of transcriptional and epigenetic remodelling in female human germ cells.

Yet, the extent to which the advent of agriculture impacted the evolution of the human immune system remains unknown. Here we present a comparative study of variation in the transcriptional responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to bacterial and viral stimuli between the Batwa, a rainforest hunter-gatherer, and the Bakiga, an agriculturalist population from Central Africa. We observed increased divergence between hunter-gatherers and farmers in the transcriptional response to viruses compared to that for bacterial stimuli. We demonstrate that a significant fraction of these transcriptional differences are under genetic control, and we show that positive natural selection has helped to shape population differences in immune regulation. Unexpectedly, we found stronger signatures of recent natural selection in the rainforest hunter-gatherers, which argues against the popularized notion that shifts in pathogen exposure due to the advent of agriculture imposed radically heightened selective pressures in agriculturalist populations.

We report that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB) signaling are strong opposite modulators of key CAF effector genes. While FGF activation in normal human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) induces a number of mitogenic growth factors and metalloproteases, it suppresses expression of pro-fibrotic and cancer-associated extracellular matrix proteins, with TGFB exerting reverse effects. Genetic abrogation or pharmacological inhibition of either pathway results in induction of CAF effector genes responsive to the other, with the ETV1 transcription factor mediating FGF effects and suppressing those of TGFB. This duality of FGF- and TGFB- signaling is reflected in the distinct gene expression profiles of HDFs derived from a large cohort of individuals, multiple Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)-derived CAF strains and stromal fibroblasts underlying premalignant (Actinic Keratoses) and desmoplastic versus non-desmoplastic skin SCC lesions. Functionally, an altered balance between FGF or TGFB signaling, by genetic suppression of either, is sufficient to confer upon HDFs growth enhancing properties on neighboring SCC cells, in vitro and in vivo, in an orthotopic skin cancer model. Thus, activation of heterogeneous CAF populations by deregulation of distinct signaling pathways converges on cancer development with implications of translational significance.

Acidification of several human and murine cell lines, as well as primary murine T cells, suppresses mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORc1) signaling, a key regulator of translation in response to metabolic status. We find acid drives peripheral redistribution of normally perinuclear lysosomes, inhibiting lysosome-bound mTOR. Restoring mTORc1 signaling and the translation it governs rescues clock oscillation, revealing a model in which lactic acid produced during the cellular metabolic response to hypoxia suppresses the circadian clock through diminished translation of clock constituents.

Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped reads per sample to the human genome (build hg19) and identified transcripts in both patient and controls with STAR workflow. We applied a machine learning approach to eliminate targets with redundant miRNA-mediated control. This strategy finds a convergence on the Myb oncogene and less prominent effects on the Hpb1 transcription factor.

The data from triplicate run were averaged and statistically analysed using SIMCA 14.1 Results: Based on neutralizing antibody titers, subjects were subsequently classified into three groups; non responders (NRs), low responders (LRs) and high responders (HRs). Post vaccination differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with innate immunity and cytokine pathways were highly upregulated. DEG analysis revealed a significant induction of CD69 expression in the HRs. High resolution metabolomics (HRM) analysis showed that correlated to the antibody response, cholesteryl nitrolinoleate and octanoyl-carnitine were significantly elevated in HRs, while chenodeoxycholic acid and methyl palmitate were upregulated in NRs and LRs, but not HRs. Additionally, gene-metabolite interaction revealed upregulated gene-metabolite couplings in, folate biosynthesis, nicotinate and nicotinamide, arachidonic acid, thiamine and pyrimidine metabolism in a dose dependent manner in HR group. Conclusions: Our data provide new insight into the underlying mechanisms of the HantavaxTM-mediated immunogenicity in humans. Our study illustrate the potential for transcriptomics and untargeted metabolomics to identify genes and metabolites involved in immune responses which may propose a targeted vaccine design in future. Overall design: Systems vaccinology analyses were performed based on two different approaches: vaccination instance and responsiveness to the vaccine. In our study we vaccinated a total of 20 subjects with 4 doses. However, 1 subject (subject or sample # 3) was excluded from transcriptomic study after first vaccination due to abnormal antibody titer.

Methods: Knockdown of target genes in breast cancer cell lines was achieved using scramble and/or gene-specific siRNA (ON-TARGET SMARTpool, Thermo Scientific) and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX.  48h post transfection, total RNA was isolated from cell lines using the RNeasy Plus mini prep kit (Qiagen). Nucleic acid quality was determined with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. RNA Sequencing was also performed at the New York Genome Center (Manhattan, NY, USA) using a HiSeq 2500 Ultra-High-Throughput Sequencing System (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Results: Raw reads in the fastq format were aligned to Human Genome HG19 using the RNA-seq STAR aligner version 2.4.0d (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23104886, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26334920) as recommended by user manual downloaded along with the software. STAR aligner was chosen for mapping accuracy and speed (http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n12/full/nmeth.2722.html).

Our group has previously identified novel cancer stroma gene expression signatures associated with outcome differences in breast cancer by gene expression profiling of two tumors of fibroblasts as surrogates for physiologic stromal expression patterns.  The aim of this study is to find additional new types of tumor stroma gene expression patterns. Results:  53 tumors were sequenced by 3SEQ with an average of 29 million reads per sample.  Both the elastofibroma (EF) and fibroma of tendon sheath (FOTS) gene signatures demonstrated robust outcome results for survival in the four breast cancer datasets.  The EF signature positive breast cancers (20-33% of the cohort) demonstrated significantly better outcome for survival.  In contrast, the FOTS signature positive breast cancers (11-35% of the cohort) had a worse outcome.  The combined stromal signatures of EF, FOTS, and our previously identified DTF, and CSF1 signatures characterize, in part, the stromal expression profile for the tumor microenvironment for between 74%-90% of all breast cancers. Conclusions:  We defined and validated two new stromal signatures in breast cancer (EF and FOTS), which are significantly associated with prognosis. Overall design: Gene expression profiling by 3SEQ was performed on 8 additional types of fibrous tumors, to identify different fibrous tumor specific gene expression signatures.  We then determined the significance of the fibrous tumor gene signatures in four publically available breast cancer datasets (GSE1456, GSE4922, GSE3494, NKI Dataset)."

After translocation into host cells it enters the nucleus but neither a nuclear activity nor the mechanisms underlying nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of YopM have been reported. Here we identify the DEAD-box helicase DDX3 as a novel interaction partner of YopM and describe a 2:1 YopM:DDX3 molecular complex in solution. Knockdown of DDX3 or inhibition of the exportin CRM1 increased the nuclear level of YopM and enhanced phosphorylation of nuclear Ribosomal S6 Kinase 1 (RSK1). Transcriptome analysis of Y. enterocolitica infected human macrophages revealed extensive suppression of immune/inflammatory pathways by YopM. Thus, YopM binds DDX3 to exit the nucleus via the CRM1 export pathway and the enabled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of YopM adjusts phosphorylation of nuclear RSK1. These YopM activities result in a coordinated subversion of immune response pathways."

We found that the inactive X-chromosome (Xi) of primed hESCs was reactivated in naïve culture conditions. Similar to cells of the blastocyst, resulting naive cells exhibited two active X-chromosomes with XIST expression and chromosome-wide transcriptional dampening, and initiated XIST-mediated X-inactivation upon differentiation. Both establishment and exit from the naïve state (differentiation) happened via an XIST-negative XaXa intermediate. Together, these findings identify a cell culture system for functionally exploring the two X-chromosome dosage compensation processes in early human development: X-dampening and X-inactivation. Furthermore, the naïve state reset Xi abnormalities of primed hESCs, providing cells better suited for downstream applications. However, naïve hESCs displayed differences to the embryo because XIST expression was predominantly mono-allelic instead of bi-allelic, and X-inactivation was non-random, indicating the need for further culture improvement."

While BT474 should be sensitive to the drug treatment, HCC1954 is expected to be resistant due to a PI3K mutation. The cell line BTR50 has been derived from BT474 and was cultured to be resistant as well. Based on RNA-Seq data, we performed differential expression analyses on these breast cancer cell lines with and without trastuzumab treatment. In detail, five separate tests were performed, namely resistant cells vs. wild type, i.e. HCC1954 and BTR50 vs. BT474, respectively, and untreated vs. drug treated cells. The significant genes of the first two tests should contribute to resistance. The significant genes of the test BT474 vs. its drug treated version should contribute to the trastuzumab effect. To exclude false positives from the combined gene set (#64), we removed ten genes that were also significant in the test BTR50 vs. its drug treated version. This way we ended up with 54 genes that are very likely to determine trastuzumab efficiency in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines. Overall design: mRNA profiles of human breast cancer cell lines were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000. The cell lines BT474 and HCC1954 were analyzed with and without trastuzumab treatment. HCC1954 is known to be trastuzumab resistant.

However, during G1 active RB can be mono-phosphorylated on any one of 14 CDK phosphorylation sites. Here we used quantitative proteomics to profile protein complexes formed by each mono-phosphorylated RB isoform (mP-RB) and identified the associated transcriptional outputs. The results show that the 14 sites of mono-phosphorylation co-ordinate RB's interactions and confer functional specificity. All 14 mP-RBs interact with E2F/DP proteins but they provide different shades of E2F regulation. RB mono-phosphorylation at S811, for example, alters RB transcriptional activity by promoting its association with NuRD complexes. The greatest functional differences between mP-RBs are evident beyond the cell cycle machinery. RB mono-phosphorylation at S811 or T826 stimulates the expression of oxidative phosphorylation genes, increasing cellular oxygen consumption. These results indicate that RB activation signals are integrated in a phosphorylation code that determines the diversity of RB activity.

Transcriptomics has been a powerful tool to explore chemical-biological interactions. However, limited throughput, high-costs and complexity of transcriptomic interpretations have yielded numerous studies lacking sufficient experimental context for predictive application. We utilized a novel high-throughput transcriptomics platform to explore a broad range of exposures to 24 reference compounds in both differentiated and undifferentiated human HepaRG cultures. Our goals were to 1) explore transcriptomic characteristics distinguishing liver injury compounds, 2) assess impacts of differentiation state on baseline and compound-induced responses (e.g., metabolically-activated), and 3) identify and resolve reference biological-response pathways and their quantitative translation to human exposures. Study data revealed the predictive utility of transcriptomic concentration-response modeling to quantitatively identify human liver injury compounds by their respective benchmark concentrations (BMCs), and model hepatic responses to classical reference compounds yielding plausibly-relevant estimations of human potency."

They act primarily by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor, resulting in direct and indirect effects on gene expression. The current understanding of glucocorticoid effects on transcription in human cells is based mostly on studies of cancer cell lines, immortalized cell lines, or highly mixed populations of primary cells (such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells). To advance the understanding of the transcriptome-wide effects of glucocorticoids on highly pure populations of primary human cells, we performed RNA-seq on nine such cell populations at two time points after in vitro exposure to methylprednisolone or vehicle. Overall design: Nine cell types were studied: four hematopoietic (circulating B cells, CD4+ T cells, monocytes, and neutrophils) and five non-hematopoietic (endothelial cells, fibroblasts, myoblasts, osteoblasts, and preadipocytes). Each cell type was obtained from a separate cohort of 4 unrelated healthy human donors (4 biological replicates per cell type: BR1 - BR4). Cells form each donor were independently cultured and exposed in vitro to glucocorticoid or vehicle. Non-hematopoietic cells were incubated until the early plateau phase of growth, then exposed to methylprednisolone or vehicle. Hematopoietic cells were collected from peripheral blood, purified by magnetic selection (negative selection for B cells, CD4+ T cells and neutrophils; positive selection for monocytes). Purified B cells, CD4+ T cells, and monocytes were incubated overnight, then exposed to methylprednisolone or vehicle. Purified neutrophils were cultured for 4 hours, then exposed to methylprednisolone or vehicle. Ethanol was used as a vehicle for methylprednisolone. Estimated final concentrations were 8500 mcg/L (22.7 mcM) for methylprednisolone and 0.07% (15.57 mM) for ethanol (vehicle). For each cell type, samples were collected at two time points after treatment with methylprednisolone or vehicle: 2 hours and 6 hours.

The function and development of ltNK cells remain poorly understood. In this study we performed RNA sequencing on the CD56bright and CD56dim NK cells (from bone marrow and blood), and the ltNK cells (from bone marrow). In addition, the blood derived CD56dim, and bone marrow derived ltNK cells were further subdivided into a NKG2A+ and NKG2A- fraction. Paired blood and bone marrow samples of 4 healthy donors were included. When comparing the NKG2A fractions, only 3 genes (of 9382 genes included) had a significantly differential expression. Therefore, we pooled the expression data proportionally from the NKG2A+ and NKG2A- fractions in subsequent analyses. In ltNK cells, 1353 genes were differentially expressed compared to circulating NK cells. Several molecules involved in migration were downregulated in ltNK cells: S1PR1, SELPLG and CD62L. By flow cytometry we confirmed that the expression profile of adhesion molecules (CD49e-, CD29low, CD81high, CD62L-, CD11c-) and transcription factors (Eomeshigh, Tbetlow) of ltNK cells differed from their circulating counterparts. LtNK cells were characterized by enhanced expression of inhibitory receptors TIGIT and CD96 and low expression of DNAM1 and cytolytic molecules (GZMB, GZMH, GNLY). Their proliferative capacity was reduced compared to the circulating NK cells. By performing gene set enrichment analysis we identified DUSP6 and EGR2 as potential regulators of the ltNK cell transcriptome. Remarkably, comparison of the ltNK cell transcriptome to the published human spleen-resident memory CD8+ T (Trm) cell transcriptome revealed an overlapping gene signature. Moreover, the phenotypic profile of ltNK cells resembled that of CD8+ Trm cells in bone marrow. Together, we provide a comprehensive molecular framework of the conventional CD56bright and CD56dim NK cells as well as the tissue-resident ltNK cells and provide a core gene signature which might be involved in promoting tissue-residency. Overall design: mRNA sequencing of NK cell populations isolated from blood: CD56bright, NKG2A+ CD56dim and NKG2A- CD56dim, and bone marrow: CD56bright, CD56dim, NKG2A+ ltNK, and NKG2A- ltNK.

Biophysical measurements are collected with a serial suspended microchannel resonator platform (sSMR) that utilizes automated fluidic state switching to load individual cells at fixed intervals, achieving a throughput of 120 cells per hour. Each single-cell is subsequently captured downstream for linked molecular analysis using an automated collection system. From linked measurements of a murine leukemia (L1210) and pro-B cell line (FL5.12), we identify gene expression signatures that correlate significantly with cell mass and growth rate. In particular, we find that both cell lines display a cell-cycle signature that correlates with cell mass, with early and late cell-cycle signatures significantly enriched amongst genes with negative and positive correlations with mass, respectively. FL5.12 cells also show a significant correlation between single-cell growth efficiency and a G1-S transition signature, providing additional transcriptional evidence for a phenomenon previously observed through biophysical measurements alone. Importantly, the throughput and speed of our platform allows for the characterization of phenotypes in dynamic cellular systems. As a proof-of principle, we apply our system to characterize activated murine CD8+ T cells and uncover two unique features of CD8+ T cells as they become proliferative in response to activation: i) the level of coordination between cell cycle gene expression and cell mass increases, and ii) translation-related gene expression increases and shows a correlation with single-cell growth efficiency. Overall, our approach provides a new means of characterizing the transcriptional mechanisms of normal and dysfunctional cellular mass and growth rate regulation across a range of biological contexts. Overall design: Single-cell RNA-Sequencing of L1210 cells, FL5.12 cells, activated T cells, and cells from a patient derived glioblastoma cell line."

We report results from single-end Illumina-based RNA-sequencing of 53 primary breast cancers and 6 ""normal"" breast samples from mammoplasty patients, using both 29 bp reads (on 29 tumor samples) and 100 bp reads (on 24 tumor samples and 6 normals). Novel as well as widely used computational approaches were used to identify differentially expressed splice variants of known RefSeq genes. This analysis identified a number of variants differentially spliced in subsets of breast tumor samples. Some of these splice variants were specific to either ER+ or ER- breast cancers, including the prostate cancer oncogene TPD52/PrLZ and intronic-start variants of genes IQCG and ACOX2, both of which have been implicated as potentially oncogenic in other cancers. We also found differential splicing in subsets of breast cancer samples which did not associate with ER or HER2 status, including a novel short-form Lactoferrin variant similar to dLTF, and the secreted protein NESP55 at the biallelically imprinted GNAS locus. The expression of several variants were verified in both tumor samples and breast cancer derived cell lines using RT-PCR. These data demonstrate that differential use of transcript variants may play an important role in the phenotype of breast cancer subtypes, and can be robustly identified by RNA sequencing analysis."

Since then, the genetic properties that define the cancer cells have been heavily investigated, however, the genetic mediators within the organ microenvironment that mediate successful metastatic growth are less understood. In these studies, a set of human breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) metastasis models were utilized. Mammary tumors and metastases to the liver, lung, and brain were RNA-sequenced with the goal of identifying complementary cancer and organ-specific genetic properties that mediate metastatic growth. During metastatic growth of PDXs, the genetic changes that occurred in the liver and lung microenvironment were more consistent and higher in magnitude than the cancer cell transcriptomes . Integration of the liver microenvironment gene signature into genetic data from liver metastasis autopsy samples or fine-needle aspirates revealed the contribution of the microenvironment to the metastatic transcriptome. These insights identify cancer and organ-specific genetic drivers  of metastasis.

In a randomised, cross-over study, we evaluate the changes in the whole blood transcriptome after the intake of a probiotic yoghurt compared to a milk acidified with gluconic acid in seven healthy young men. The effects of the dairy foods on whole blood gene expression were assessed at three time points during a 6 h postprandial test (800g single dose) and in the fasting state after a daily intake of the products over two-weeks (400g/d). RNA was extracted from Paxgene ® whole blood samples and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform.

Here, we present gene expression profiles of purified microglia isolated at autopsy from the parietal cortex of 39 human subjects with intact cognition. We identified an age-associated gene signature in human microglia that was enriched for genes involved in cell adhesion, axonal guidance, cell surface receptor expression, and actin disassembly. Methods: mRNA profiles of 39 human microglia samples isolated from subjects with intact cognition, 16 corresponding superior parietal cortex tissue and 10 epilepsy surgical samples were generated in a Illumina HiSEQ 2500 sequencer. mRNA profiles of 6 parietal cortex from mice were prepared with a Quantseq 3'mRNA-Seq kit (Lexogen, USA). Reads were aligned to the hg38 assembly of the human genome using STAR and quantified at the gene level by featureCounts. Differential expression between whole brain tissue, surgical samples and isolated microglia was assessed with limma. Results: Overall, genes expressed by human microglia are similar to those in mouse, including established microglia genes CX3CR1, P2YR12, and ITGAM/CD11B. However, a number of immune genes, not identified as part of the mouse microglial signature, were abundantly expressed in human microglia, including TLR, Fc-gamma? and SIGLEC receptors, as well as TAL1 and IFI16, regulators of proliferation and cell cycle. Age-associated changes in human microglia were enriched for genes involved in cell adhesion, axonal guidance, cell surface receptor expression, and actin (dis)assembly. Limited overlap was observed in microglial genes regulated during aging between mice and humans, indicating that human and mouse microglia age differently. Conclusions: Here we present the an extensive human microglia gene expression profile. Critical differences with mouse microglia, especially in the context of aging, were observed which highlight the necessity to independently study human microglia. These data and analyses serve as a starting point to address human-specific microglia genes and functions under physiological and neuropathological conditions. Overall design: mRNA profiles of 39 human microglia samples isolated from subjects with intact cognition, 16 corresponding superior parietal cortex tissue and 10 epilepsy surgical samples were generated in a Illumina HiSEQ 2500 sequencer. mRNA profiles of 6 parietal cortex from mice were prepared with a Quantseq 3'mRNA-Seq kit (Lexogen, USA)."

For soldiers exposed to combat, the risk of developing this disorder is two-fold and diagnosis is often late, when much sequela has set in. To be able to identify and diagnose in advance those at “risk” of developing PTSD, would greatly taper the gap between late sequelae and treatment. Therefore, this study sought to test the hypothesis that the transcriptome can be used to track the development of PTSD in this unique and susceptible cohort of individuals. Gene expression levels in peripheral blood samples from 85 Canadian infantry soldiers (n = 58 subjects negative for PTSD symptoms and n = 27 subjects with PTSD symptoms) were determined by RNA sequencing technology following their return from deployment to Afghanistan. Count-based gene expression quantification, normalization and differential analysis (with thorough correction for confounders) revealed significant differences in two genes, LRP8 and GOLM1 . These preliminary results provide a proof-of-principle for the diagnostic utility of blood-based gene expression profiles for tracking symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in soldiers returning from tour.

We characterized one ncRNA, PCAT-1, as a prostate-specific regulator of cell proliferation and show that it is a target of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). We further found that patterns of PCAT-1 and PRC2 expression stratified patient tissues into molecular subtypes distinguished by expression signatures of PCAT-1–repressed target genes. Taken together, our findings suggest that PCAT-1 is a transcriptional repressor implicated in a subset of prostate cancer patients.

We examined the metabolome, proteome, and transcriptome of 150 patients with critical illness, stratified by renal function. Plasma metabolite values showed greater changes as renal function declined, with the greatest derangements in patients receiving chronic HD. Specifically, 6 uremic retention molecules, 17 other protein catabolites, 7 modified nucleosides, and 7 pentose phosphate sugars increased as renal function declined, consistent with decreased excretion or increased catabolism of amino acids and ribonucleotides. Similarly, the proteome showed increased levels of low-molecular weight proteins and acute phase reactants. The transcriptome revealed a broad-based decrease in mRNA levels among HD patients. Systems integration revealed an unrecognized association between plasma RNASE1 and several RNA catabolites and modified nucleosides. Further, allantoin, N1-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide, and n-acetylaspartate showed inverse correlations with the majority of significantly down-regulated genes. In conclusion, renal function broadly affected the plasma metabolome, proteome, and peripheral blood transcriptome during critical illness. These changes were not effectively mitigated by hemodialysis. These studies suggest several novel mechanisms whereby renal dysfunction contributes to critical illness.

Recent studies have proposed several methods for RNA-Seq of low quality and/or low quantity samples, but their relative merits have not been systematically analyzed. Here, we compare five such methods using a comprehensive set of metrics, relevant to applications such as transcriptome annotation, transcript discovery, and gene expression. Using a single human RNA sample, we constructed and deeply sequenced 10 libraries with these methods and two control libraries. We find that the RNase H method performed best for low quality RNA, and can even effectively replace oligo (dT) based methods for standard RNA-Seq. SMART and NuGEN had distinct strengths for low quantity RNA. Our analysis allows biologists to select the most suitable methods and provides a benchmark for future method development.

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP001540",161,"Understaning mechanisms underlying human gene expression variation with RNA sequencing","Understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying natural variation in gene expression is a central goal of both medical and evolutionary genetics, and studies of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have become an important tool for achieving this goal. While all eQTL studies to date have assayed mRNA levels using expression microarrays, recent advances in RNA sequencing enable the analysis of transcript variation at unprecedented resolution. We sequenced RNA from 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from unrelated Nigerian individuals that have been extensively genotyped by the International HapMap Project. Pooling data from all individuals, we generated a map of the transcriptional landscape of these cells, identifying extensive use of unannotated polyadenylation sites and over 100 novel putative protein-coding exons.  Using the genotypes from the HapMap project, we identified over a thousand genes at which genetic variation influences overall expression levels or splicing. We demonstrate that eQTLs near genes generally act via a mechanism involving allele-specific expression, and that variation that influences the inclusion of an exon is enriched within or near the consensus splice sites. Our results illustrate the power of high-throughput sequencing for the joint analysis of variation in transcription, splicing, and allele-specific expression across individuals. Overall design: RNA-Seq in 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines from multiple Yoruban HapMap individuals in at least two replicate lanes per individual"

The high-pressure to integrate the technology into daily laboratory live requires solid knowledge with respect to potential limitations and precautions to be taken care of before applying it to complex research questions. In the past, we have identified two issues with quality measures neglected by the growing community involving SmartSeq and droplet or micro-well based scRNASeq methods – i) how to ensure that only single-cells are introduced without biasing on light-scattering when handling complex cell mixtures and organ preparations or ii) how best to control for (pro-)apoptotic cell contaminations in single-cell sequencing approaches. Sighting of concurrent literature involving single-cell sequencing technologies revealed that these topics are generally neglected or simply approached in silico but not at the bench before generating single-cell data sets. We fear that those important quality aspects are overlooked due to reduced awareness of their importance for guaranteeing the quality of experiments. In this Cytometry rigour issue, we provide experimentally supported guidance on how to circumvent those critical shortcomings in order to promote a better use of the fantastic single-cell sequencing toolbox in biology."

We show that genomic analysis of acquired resistance to MAPK inhibitors revealed key driver genes but failedto adequately account for clinical resistance. From a large-scale comparative analysis of temporal transcriptomes from patient-matched tumor biopsies, we discovered highly recurrent differential expression and signature outputs of c-MET, LEF1 and YAP1 as drivers of acquired MAPK inhibitor resistance. Moreover, integration of gene- and signature-based transcriptomic analysis revealed profound CD8 T cell deficiency detected in half of resistant melanomas in association with downregulation of dendritic cells and antigen presentation. We also propose a major methylomic basis to transcriptomic evolution under MAPK inhibitor selection. Thus, this database provides a rich informational resource, and the current landscape represents a benchmark to understanding melanoma therapeutic resistance.

While clinical trials have reported single-agent activity in advanced hematologic malignancies, mechanisms determining the response to BET inhibition remain poorly understood. To identify factors involved in primary and acquired BET resistance in leukemia, we performed a chromatin-focused shRNAmir screen in a sensitive MLL/AF9; NrasG12D-driven AML model, and investigated dynamic transcriptional profiles in sensitive and resistant murine and human leukemias. Our screen reveals that suppression of the PRC2 complex, contrary to effects in other contexts, promotes BET resistance in AML. PRC2 suppression does not directly affect the regulation of Brd4-dependent transcripts, but facilitates the remodeling of regulatory pathways that restore the transcription of key targets such as Myc. Similarly, while BET inhibition triggers acute MYC repression in human leukemias regardless of their sensitivity, resistant leukemias are uniformly characterized by their ability to rapidly restore MYC transcription. This process involves the activation and recruitment of WNT signaling components, which compensate for the loss of BRD4 and drive resistance in various cancer models. Dynamic ChIP- and STARR-seq enhancer profiles reveal that BET-resistant states are characterized by remodeled regulatory landscapes, involving the activation of a focal MYC enhancer that recruits WNT machinery in response to BET inhibition. Together, our results identify and validate WNT signaling as a driver and candidate biomarker of primary and acquired BET resistance in leukemia, and implicate the rewiring of transcriptional programs as an important mechanism promoting resistance to BET inhibitors and, potentially, other chromatin-targeted therapies. Overall design: RNA-Seq of DMSO- or JQ1-treated cancer cell lines; ChIP-seq for H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 in a leukemia cell line treated either with DMSO or JQ1, ChIP-seq for H3K27ac in resistant and sensitive mouse and human leukemia.

Here we constructed and characterized a clonal, inducible human reprogramming system that provides a reliable source of cells at any stage of the process. This system enabled integrative transcriptional and epigenomic analysis across the human reprogramming timeline at high resolution. We observed distinct waves of gene network activation, including the ordered re-activation of broad developmental regulators followed by early embryonic patterning genes and culminating in the emergence of a signature reminiscent of pre-implantation stages. Moreover, complementary functional analyses allowed us to identify and validate novel regulators of the reprogramming process. Altogether, this study sheds light on the molecular underpinnings of induced pluripotency in human cells and provides a robust cell platform for further studies.

The main objectives of this study were to identify blood biomarkers specific to brucellosis compared to other endemic infections and to monitor changes in blood biomarkers during treatment. To obtain a global profile of the disease, we employed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of whole blood RNA to measure host response against brucellosis infection in patients from Macedonia and Spain. Long-term follow up of patients was used to classify patients as having acute or chronic/reinfection brucellosis and as treatment responders and non-responders. We observed distinct gene expression differences between samples from acute brucellosis and control donors. The magnitude of gene expression changes was associated with antibody titers determined by standard serological tests for brucellosis, including the rose Bengal and standard agglutination tests. The expression signature characteristic of acute brucellosis was also different from that of subjects with leishmaniasis. In depth integration of clinical data and serological findings with our gene expression data will be performed to provide insight into cellular and molecular mechanisms of brucellosis infection.

However, standard approaches for library construction typically require relatively high amounts of input RNA, are labor intensive, and are time consuming. Here, we report the outcome of a systematic effort to optimize and streamline steps in strand-specific RNA-seq library construction, which resulted in the identification of an optimized messenger RNA isolation protocol, a potent reverse transcriptase for cDNA synthesis, an efficient chemistry, and a simplified formulation of library construction reagents. We also present an optimization of bead-based purification and size selection designed to maximize the recovery of cDNA fragments. These developments have allowed us to assemble a rapid high throughput pipeline that produces high quality data from amounts of total RNA as low as 25ng. While the focus of this study is on RNA-seq sample preparation, some of these developments are also relevant to other next-generation sequencing library types."

Those who ultimately developed TB disease (“progressors”) were compared with matched controls, who remained healthy. Whole blood transcriptomic and plasma proteome analyses showed sequential modulation of immunological processes: type I/II interferon signalling and complement cascade were elevated 18 months before TB diagnosis, while changes in myeloid inflammation and lymphoid cell, monocyte and neutrophil gene modules occurred more proximally to TB disease. Analysis of gene expression in purified T cells revealed early suppression of Th17 responses in progressors. This was confirmed in an adult BCG re-vaccination cohort, where expression of interferon response genes in blood was associated with suppression of IL-17 expression by BCG-specific CD4 cells. We concluded that sequential inflammatory dynamics and immune alteration precede TB disease manifestation, with important implications for developing diagnostics, vaccines and host-directed therapies for TB. Overall design: 6,363 healthy adolescents, aged 12-18 years and enrolled into the Adolescent Cohort Study (ACS) (Zak et al. 2016), were followed for 24 months or more.

Supporting the contractility of lymphatic collectors is an attractive target for pharmacological therapy of lymphedema. However, lymphatics have mostly been studied in animals, while the cellular and molecular characteristics of human lymphatic collectors are largely unknown. We studied epifascial lymphatic collectors of the thigh, which were isolated for autologous transplantations. Our immunohistological studies identify additional markers for LECs (vimentin, CCBE-1). We show and confirm differences between initial and collecting lymphatics concerning the markers ESAM1, D2-40 and LYVE-1. Our transmission electron microscopic studies reveal two types of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the media of the collectors with dark and light cytoplasm. We observed vasa vasorum in the media of the largest collectors, as well as interstitial Cajal-like cells, which are highly ramified cells with long processes, caveolae, and lacking a basal lamina. They are in close contact with SMCs, which possess multiple caveolae at the contact sites. Immunohistologically we identified such cells with antibodies against vimentin and PDGFRa, but not CD34 and cKIT. With Next Generation Sequencing we searched for highly expressed genes in the media of lymphatic collectors, and found therapeutic targets, suitable for acceleration of lymphatic contractility, such as neuropeptide Y receptors 1, and 5; tachykinin receptors 1, and 2; purinergic receptors P2RX1, and 6, P2RY12, 13, and 14; 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors HTR2B, and 3C; and adrenoceptors a2A,B,C.

We examined natural variation of miRNA expression in adipose tissue in a population of 200 men who have been carefully characterized for metabolic syndrome phenotypes as part of the METSIM study. We genotyped the subjects using high-density SNP microarrays and quantified the mRNA abundance using genome-wide expression arrays and miRNA abundance using next generation sequencing. We reliably quantified 356 miRNA species that were expressed in human adipose tissue, a limited number of which made up most of the expressed miRNAs. We mapped the miRNA abundance as an expression quantitative trait and determined cis regulation of expression for 9 of the miRNAs and of the processing of one miRNA (miR-28). The degree of genetic variation of miRNA expression was substantially less than that of mRNAs. For the majority of the miRNAs, genetic regulation of expression was independent of the host mRNA transcript expression. We also showed that for 108 miRNAs, mapped reads displayed widespread variation from the canonical sequence. We found a total of 24 miRNAs to be significantly associated with metabolic syndrome traits. We suggest a regulatory role for miR-204-5p which was predicted to inhibit ACACB, a key fatty acid oxidation enzyme that has been shown to play a role in regulating body fat and insulin resistance in adipose tissue.

Defining the downstream regulatory mechanisms influenced by cytokines is central to defining drug and disease mechanisms. One promising strategy is to use interactions between expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and cytokine levels to define target genes and mechanisms.   Results: In a clinical trial for anti-IL-6 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus we measured interferon (IFN) status, anti-IL-6 drug exposure and whole blood genome-wide gene expression at three time points (379 samples from 157 individuals). First, we show that repeat transcriptomic measurements increases the number of cis eQTLs identified compared to using a single time point by 64%. Then, after identifying 4,818 cis-eQTLs, we observed a statistically significant enrichment of in vivo eQTL interactions with IFN status (p<0.001 by permutation) and anti-IL-6 drug exposure (p<0.001). We observed 210 and 72 interactions for IFN and anti-IL-6 respectively (FDR<20%). Anti-IL-6 interactions have not yet been described while 99 of the IFN interactions are novel. Finally, we found transcription factor binding motifs interrupted by eQTL interaction SNPs, pointing to key regulatory mediators of these environmental stimuli and therefore potential therapeutic targets for autoimmune diseases. In particular, genes with IFN interactions are enriched for ISRE binding site motifs, while those with anti-IL-6 interactions are enriched for IRF4 motifs.   Conclusion: This study highlights the potential to exploit clinical trial data to discover in vivo eQTL interactions with therapeutically relevant environmental variables.

Dysregulated mTOR signalling has been shown in cancer, COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). mTOR forms the catalytic subunit of 2 protein complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2 which differ in upstream inputs, downstream effects and sensitivity to the allosteric inhibitor rapamycin. Aim: To compare the effects of the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin with an ATP-competitive inhibitor of mTORC1/2, AZD8055, on TGFß1 induced transcriptional responses during myofibroblast differentiation by RNA-Seq analysis. Methods: Primary human lung fibroblasts were treated with TGFß1 for 24h to induce myofibroblast differentiation and extra cellular matrix (ECM) production in the presence of rapamycin or AZD8055. Fibroblasts were also treated with rapamycin or AZD8055 without TGFß1. Total mRNA was analysed by RNA-Seq. Results: On a global transcriptomic level, TGFß1 significantly affected the expression of ~4,200 genes by more than 1.5 fold, of which ~1,100 changes were reversed by pan-mTORC1/2 inhibition, while being insensitive to rapamycin. Only 15 gene changes were reversed exclusively by rapamycin. Analysis of the rapamycin-insensitive, mTOR sensitive myofibroblast transcriptome revealed ECM-receptor interaction, metabolism and actin cytoskeleton regulation as major affected pathways. Conclusions: Our data support the conclusion that therapeutic approaches aimed at interfering with TGFb1 induced myofibroblast differentiation and ECM production require dual mTOR1/2 inhibition and may, in part, explain the lack of clinical efficacy of everolimus in the context of IPF. Overall design: Primary human lung fibroblasts were treated with TGFß1 for 24h in the presence of rapamycin or AZD8055. Each treatment was done in quadruplicates, for a total of 16 samples. Untreated cells were used as control. Paired-end RNA sequencing was performed with the NextSeq sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Each sample was run on 4 different lanes."

EWS/FLI regulates myriad genes required for Ewing sarcoma development.  EWS/FLI binds GGAA-microsatellite sequences in vivo and in vitro, and these sequences provide EWS/FLI-mediated activation to reporter constructs, suggesting that they function as EWS/FLI-response elements.  Genomic GGAA-microsatellites are highly variable and polymorphic.  Current data suggest that there is an optimal “sweet-spot” GGAA-microsatellite length (of 18-26 GGAA repeats) that confers maximal EWS/FLI-responsiveness to target genes, but the mechanistic basis for this was not known.  We now demonstrate the absolute necessity of an EWS/FLI-bound GGAA-microsatellite in regulation of the NR0B1 gene, as well as for Ewing sarcoma proliferation and oncogenic transformation.  Biochemical studies, using recombinant ?22 (a version of EWS/FLI containing only the FLI portion) demonstrated a stoichiometry of one ?22-monomer binding to every two consecutive GGAA-repeats on shorter GGAA-microsatellite sequences.  Surprisingly, the affinity for ?22 binding to GGAA-microsatellites significantly decreased, and ultimately became unmeasureable, when the size of the GGAA-microsatellite was increased to the “sweet-spot” length.  In contrast, a fully-functional EWS/FLI mutant (Mut9) that retains approximately half of the EWS portion of the fusion showed low affinity for smaller GGAA-microsatellites, but instead significantly increased its affinity at “sweet-spot” microsatellite lengths.  Single-gene ChIP and genome-wide ChIP-seq and RNA-seq studies extended these findings to the in vivo setting.  Taken together, these data demonstrate the absolute requirement of GGAA-microsatellites as EWS/FLI activating response elements in vivo and reveal an unsuspected novel role for the EWS portion of the EWS/FLI fusion in binding to optimal-length GGAA-microsatellites. Overall design: The treatments applied to our RNA-seq A673 samples were for EWS/FLI knockdown/rescue experiments.

Advanced statistics, microfluidics RT-PCR and protein measurements validated known and novel APA-modified 3'-intact transcripts. Moreover, APA modifications, more than total transcript counts, distinguished AD patients from both controls and NDWP donors and identified cell type-characteristic, cognition-associated and neuropathology-related changes. AD-enhanced APA variants included known therapeutic targets of brain, vascular and autoimmune disorders, predicting co-involvement of these target genes in AD progression; AD/NDWP increases in 3'-intact proteinopathy-related hnRNP mRNAs were inversely associated with protein decreases, whereas NDWP-potentiated cognition was accompanied by distinct ATP and mitochondrial variants. APA variations thus provide a novel resource of unique value for both basic and translational neuroscience researchers.

We show here that newly developed 70-gene and 80-gene RNA-seq tests deliver equivalent technical and clinical results to the reference standard microarray tests, they are highly reproducible when performed in different locations and they are stable over-time.

Here, we report that the active intracellular portion of NOTCH1 (ICN1) is detectable in ~50% of peripheral blood CLL cases lacking gene mutations. We identify a ‘NOTCH1 CLL gene expression signature’ in CLL cells, and show that this signature is significantly enriched in primary CLL cases expressing ICN1, independent of NOTCH1 mutation. NOTCH1 target genes include key regulators of B-cell proliferation, survival and signal transduction physiology. In particular, we show that MYC is a direct target of NOTCH1 via B-cell specific distal regulatory elements, thus implicating this oncogene in the pathogenesis of the disease.

Here we conducted the first study of the global transcriptome of patients with Lyme disease to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers.  Twenty-nine patients were enrolled and compared to 13 healthy controls at three time points after infection.  Fifteen publicly available transcriptome datasets from patients in vivo or infection models in vitro were used to assess specificity of differentially expressed genes (DEGs).  We found that Lyme disease results in profound and sustained changes in the patient transcriptomes, with a specific signature that shares =44% DEGs with other infections. Overall design: Gene expression profile from peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMC) of Lyme disease patients against healthy controls was undertaken. A total of 29 Lyme disease patients were sampled at 3 time points: acute Lyme pre-treatment (V1), 3 weeks later, immediately following completion of a standard course of antibiotics (V2), and 6 months following treatment completion (V5). 13 healthy controls were also sampled at one time point.

Transcriptional and epigenetic changes have been investigated to facilitate our understanding of the reprogramming process. Here, we extended the previous transcriptome studies by performing RNA-seq on cells defined by a combination of multiple cellular surface markers. We found that transcriptome changes during early reprogramming occur independently from the opening of closed chromatin by OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC (OSKM). Furthermore, our data identify multiple spliced forms of genes uniquely expressed at each progressive stage of reprogramming. In particular, we found a pluripotency-specific spliced form of CCNE1 that significantly enhances reprogramming. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) expression analysis reveals that monoallelic gene expression is induced in the intermediate stages of reprogramming while biallelic expression is recovered upon completion of reprogramming. Our transcriptome data provide unique opportunities in understanding human iPSC reprogramming. Overall design: RNA samples from intermediates of hiPSC reprogramming were obtained.

An untapped alternative is to enhance the efficacy and safety of existing cancer treatments. We hypothesized that the response to topoisomerase II poisons, the most successful group of cancer drugs, can be improved by considering treatment-associated transcript levels, taken as surrogates for protein expression. To this end, we analyzed transcriptomes from Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cell lines treated with the topoisomerase II poison etoposide. Using complementary criteria of co-regulation within networks and of essentiality for cell survival, we identified and functionally confirmed 11 druggable drivers of etoposide cytotoxicity. Drivers with pre-treatment expression predicting etoposide response (e.g. PARP9) generally synergized with the drug. Drivers repressed by etoposide (e.g. PLK1) displayed standalone cytotoxicity. Drivers, whose modulation evoked etoposide-like gene expression changes (e.g. mTOR), were cytotoxic both alone and in combination with etoposide. In summary, both pre-treatment gene expression and treatment-driven changes contribute to the cell killing effect of etoposide. Inhibitors of protein products of the involved genes can be used to enhance the efficacy of etoposide. This strategy can be used to identify combination partners or even replacements for other classical anticancer drugs, especially those interfering with DNA integrity and transcription. Overall design: AML cell lines were treated with either vehicle control (media) or cell-specific IC50 concentrations of etoposide for 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted and single-end RNA sequencing was performed to idendify etoposide-evoked changes in the gene expression. The experiment was perfomed using 3 biological replicates, each for vehicle control- and etoposide-treated cells."

Abstract: Circadian clocks play a key role in regulating a vast array of biological processes, with significant implications for human health. Accurate assessment of physiological time using transcriptional biomarkers found in human blood can significantly improve diagnosis of circadian disorders and optimize the delivery time of therapeutic treatments. To be useful, such a test must be accurate, minimally burden some to the patient, and readily generalizable to new data. A major obstacle in development of gene expression biomarker tests is the diversity of measurement platforms and the inherent variability of the data, often resulting in predictors that perform well in the original datasets but cannot be universally applied to new samples collected in other settings. Here we introduce TimeSignature, a new algorithm that robustly infers circadian time from gene expression. We demonstrate its application in data from three independent studies using Pdistinct microarrays, and further validate it against a new set of samples profiled by RNA-Seq. Our results show that TimeSignature is more accurate and efficient than competing methods, estimating circadian time to within 2h for the majority of samples. Importantly, we demonstrate that once trained on data from a single study, the resulting predictor can be universally applied to yield highly accurate results in new data from other studies independent of differences in study population, patient protocol, or assay platform without renormalizing the data or retraining. This feature is unique amongst expression–based predictors, and addresses a major challenge in the development of generalizable, clinically–useful tests. Overall design: Whole blood transcriptional profiles of 11 individuals with intermediate circadian phenotype, were generated by RNA sequencing, using Illumina NextGen 500. Whole blood was collected every 2hr over 28hr (15 time points), yelding total of 165 samples, of which 153 passed the QA and underwent further analysis."

Transforming members of the MYC family (MYC, MYCL1, MYCN) encode transcription factors containing six highly conserved regions, termed MYC homology Boxes (MBs). Here, we conduct proteomic profiling of the MB interactomes, demonstrating that half of MYC interactors require one or more MBs for binding. Comprehensive phenotypic analyses revealed that two MBs are universally required for transformation. MBII interaction with acetyltransferase-containing complexes results in histone hyperacetylation and is essential for MYC-dependent tumor initiation. By contrast, MB0 interacts with transcription elongation factors through direct binding to the general transcription factor TFIIF, and deletion of MB0 severely inhibits tumor growth but is dispensable for tumor initiation. Notably, the full transforming activity of MYC can be restored upon co-expression of MB0 and MBII deletion mutants, indicating that these two regions confer unique biological functions, each required for oncogenic MYC activity. Overall design: RNA-seq analysis was conducted in TET21 cells (n=4, for each of the MYC deletion mutant ectopycally expressed) to determine the nature of the MB transcriptomes, and ChIPseq was conducted on WT-MYC TET21-expressing cells to determine MYC binding (n=1)."

Here, we report that despite the common core erythroid program that exists between cord blood- and peripheral blood-HSPC induced towards erythroid differentiation in vitro, significant functional differences exist. We undertook a comparative analysis of human erythropoiesis using these two different sources of HSPC and differentiated them in vitro. We observed that cells derived from cord blood proliferate 4.5 times more than cells derived from peripheral blood. However, these cells present a delay in their differentiation pattern due to increased quantities of progenitors, notably CFU-E. Using our method of immunophenotyping for the study of erythroid progenitors, we document the presence and maintenance of a specific population in peripheral blood-derived erythroid progenitors. This population, defined as IL3R-GPA-CD34+CD36+, has the ability to form both BFU-E and CFU-E colonies in colony-forming assays, reflecting a higher potential. To further understand the differences between cord blood- and peripheral blood- HSPC, we sorted all stages of erythropoiesis from both sources and compared their transcriptome. We document differences at the CD34, BFU-E, poly- and orthochromatic stages. Among the genes presenting the highest differences in expression, many are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and autophagy. Altogether, our studies provide a qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis of human erythropoiesis and highlight functional differences, critical to our understanding of the impact of the developmental origin of HSPCs on erythroid differentiation. Overall design: RNA was extracted from FACS-sorted cells at 8 distinct stages of erythropoiesis, derived from CB- and PB-CD34+ cells. cDNA libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq kit and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Epigenomics Core of Weill Cornell Medical College, New York). This sequencing strategy produced ~15-80 million 50bp single end reads per sample. For each distinct stage of erythropoiesis, 3 biological replicates were obtained from independently cultured and sorted samples from different donations. Quality control of reads was performed and low-quality reads removed. Reads were aligned to the hg19 reference genome using HISAT2. Raw read counts were extracted from the aligned reads using the featureCounts program. Differential expression analysis was done at each stage comparing the two original sources of CD34+ cells using the DESeq2 bioconductor package. Using gene expression data from each stage, the subset of genes differentially expressed as a function of HSPC source was clustered using divisive hierarchical clustering and split into 10 clusters.

However, generating organoids requires prompt isolation and culture of fresh tissue, which is labor and time intensive, placing restraints on basic and clinical research. For example organoid biobanking efforts, or the ability to obtain specimens from distant locations that lack the expertise to culture organoids, is limited by current approaches. We sought to develop a method by which tissue biopsies from patients could be cryo-preserved, stored, or shipped, and later thawed in order to establish live organoid cultures. Methods A method for freezing and recovery, along with straightforward isolation methods using readily available materials were developed. Epithelial isolation and culture conditions were optimized to promote cell survival and the establishment of long-term culture post-thawing. Results Patient biopsies from stomach, duodenum, ileum, colon and from adenomateous colonic polyps  were frozen, subsequently thawed and used to successfully establish patient-specific epithelium-only organoid cultures with 100% efficiency (n=31 independent patient biopsies from different regions of the GI tract). Frozen tissue could be shipped internationally and across the United States and used to establish successful organoid cultures.  Organoid cultures could be expanded, passaged and frozen down for long-term storage. RNA-sequencing demonstrates that organoids derived from fresh tissue or from frozen biopsies are >99% transcriptionally identical. Conclusions Cryo-preservation of human tissue biopsies followed by the establishment of long-term, expandable cultures has negligible effect on transcription when compared to freshly prepared organoids, and will be of immense benefit to research and for clinical applications. This technique will allow for the establishment of biobanks of human tissues that can be revived and cultured in the future as well as transported across the globe for research, therapeutic or diagnostic use in remote labs and/or clinics."

Here we report single cell transcriptomes of CD49f+ HSCs as well as those of CD49f+ Subset1 (CD19- CD38- CD45RA- CD90+ CD49f+ CD34lo CLEC9Ahi, Myelo-erythroid-skewed in vitro but Lymphoid-competent) and CD49f+ Subset2 cells (CD19- CD38- CD45RA- CD90+ CD49f+ CD34hi CLEC9Alo, Myelo-Lymphoid competent but Erythroid-deficient). We also report bulk transcriptomes of pools of 20 cells from HSC/MPP Subset1 (CD19- CD38- CD45RA- CD34lo CLEC9Ahi) and HSC/MPP Subset2 (CD19- CD38- CD45RA- CD34hi CLEC9Alo). Altogether these data show a diffuse transcriptional landscape of the CD49f+ HSC compartment, which is polarised along an axis that separates Myelo-Erythroid and Myelo-Lymphoid lineage-priming. Consistently with their differentiation capacity in vitro, CD49f+ Subset1 cells cluster at the Myelo-Erythroid end of the landscape, while CD49f+ Subset2 cells cluster at the Myelo-Lymphoid end. In addtion, these lineage-priming signatures were found to be more marked in HSC/MPP Subset1 and HSC/MPP Subset2, than in the equivalent CD49f+ subsets. In conclusion, 49f+ Subset1 and 49f+ Subset2 populations have activated distinct transcriptional lineage-priming programmes corresponding to the phenotypic lineage-skewing observed in vitro, that then become reinforced within the broader HSC/MPP pool. Altogether our data shows that lineage-priming and lineage-restriction programmes are initially established within the CD49f+ HSC subset in humans. Overall design: Examination of the genome-wide transcriptome of 192 single CD49f+ HSCs and 192 single cells from two CD49f+ HSC subsets (CD49f+ Subset1 and CD49f+ Subset2), as well as replicates of 20 cells of HSC/MPP Subset1 and HSC/MPP Subset2"

However, the exact impact that 3D culture has throughout the entire process of cardiac differentiation remains poorly defined. We developed a robust and efficient 3D platform for cardiomyocyte differentiation from hiPSCs, based on the temporal modulation of WNT signalling using small molecules. 3D aggregates of hiPSCs were generated by forced aggregation in microwells and subsequently differentiated. In order to determine the differences in gene expression profile due to 3D culture throughout the different stages of cardiac differentiation, we compared transcriptional changes between cells in 3D aggregates and standard 2D monolayer cardiac differentiation. Analysis of these data suggests a faster commitment of hiPSCs toward the cardiac lineage and also higher degree of cardiomyocyte functional maturation after 20 days of culture in the 3D aggregates when compared with the 2D monolayer. Overall design: Cells from different time points of cardiac differentiation (day 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 20), from 3D and 2D culture conditions were collected for RNA-seq. Three biological replicates were obtained for each time point. Deep sequencing was performed in the Illumina platform."

This in-vitro differentiation process generates a heterogeneous population with a proportion of cells failing to differentiate properly and maintaining expression of pluripotency factors such as Oct4. RNA-sequencing of single cells collected at four time points during a 4-day DE differentiation identified high expression of metallothionein genes in the residual Oct4-positive cells that failed to differentiate to DE. Using X-ray fluorescence microscopy and multi-isotope mass spectrometry, we discovered that high intracellular zinc level corresponds with persistent Oct4 expression and failure to differentiate. We further show that differentiation-arrested phenotype is inversely correlated with zinc concentration in the differentiation media. This study improves our understanding of in-vitro DE differentiation and provides actionable options to improve DE differentiation efficiency.

In this study, we investigated this novel transcriptional role for CLOCK in human neurons by performing chromatin-immunoprecipitation sequencing for endogenous CLOCK in adult neocortex and RNA-sequencing following CLOCK knockdown in differentiated human neurons in vitro. These data suggested that CLOCK regulates expression of genes involved in neuronal migration, and a functional assay showed that CLOCK knockdown increased neuronal migratory distance. Furthermore, dysregulation of CLOCK disrupts co-expressed networks of genes implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, and the expression of these networks are driven by hub genes with human-specific patterns of expression. Thus, these data support a role for CLOCK-regulated transcriptional cascades involved in human brain evolution and function. Overall design: We carried out RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and ATAC-sequencing (ATAC-seq) in differentiated human neural progenitor cells and ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) in both differentiated human neural progenitor cells and BA10 and BA40 of adult human neocortex. For the Chip-seq, five replicates were used for each of the two Brodmann areas (BA10 and BA40) of adult human frozen brain tissue (i.e. the five replicates of BA10 and BA40 came from the same five individuals). For the RNA-seq, three independent replicates of control and CLOCK knockdown samples were used each time point analyzed.

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP059959",58,"Long non-coding RNAs display higher natural expression variation than protein-coding genes in healthy humans","Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly implicated as gene regulators and may ultimately be more numerous than protein-coding genes in the human genome. Despite large numbers of reported lncRNAs, reference annotations are likely incomplete due to their lower and tighter tissue-specific expression compared to mRNAs. An unexplored factor potentially confounding lncRNA identification is inter-individual expression variability. Here, we characterize lncRNA natural expression variability in human primary granulocytes. Results: We annotate granulocyte lncRNAs and mRNAs in RNA-seq data from ten healthy individuals, identifying multiple lncRNAs absent from reference annotations, and use this to investigate three known features (higher tissue-specificity, lower expression, and reduced splicing efficiency) of lncRNAs relative to mRNAs. Expression variability was examined in seven individuals sampled three times at one or more than one month intervals. We show that lncRNAs display significantly more inter-individual expression variability compared to mRNAs. We confirm this finding in 2 independent human datasets by analyzing multiple tissues from the GTEx project and lymphoblastoid cell lines from the GEUVADIS project. Using the latter dataset we also show that including more human donors into the transcriptome annotation pipeline allows identification of an increasing number of lncRNAs, but minimally affects mRNA gene number. Conclusions: A comprehensive annotation of lncRNAs is known to require an approach that is sensitive to low and tight tissue-specific expression. Here we show that increased inter-individual expression variability is an additional general lncRNA feature to consider when creating a comprehensive annotation of human lncRNAs or proposing their use as prognostic or disease markers. Overall design: We used PolyA+ RNA-seq data from human primary granulocytes of 10 healthy individuals to de novo annotate lncRNAs and mRNAs in this cell type and ribosomal depleted (total) RNA-seq data from seven of these individuals sampled three times to analyze lncRNA amd mRNA expression variability"

Using a new hierarchical linear regression algorithm to score our screen results and integrate them with accompanying detailed genetic and proteomic information, we identify novel vulnerabilities in breast cancer, including new candidate “drivers,” and reveal general functional genomic properties of cancer cells. Comparisons of gene essentiality with drug sensitivity data suggest potential resistance mechanisms, novel effects of existing anti-cancer drugs, and new opportunities for combination therapy.  Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this large dataset by identifying BRD4 as a potential target in luminal breast cancer, and PIK3CA mutations as a resistance determinant for BET-inhibitors.

Clinical datasets generated on a range of different platforms continue to be deposited in public repositories provide an ever-growing, valuable resource for reanalysis. Cost and tissue availability normally preclude processing samples across multiple technologies, making it difficult to directly evaluate performance, reliability and to what extent gene expression data from different platforms can be compared or integrated. Purpose: In this study, we describe our experiences using nine new and established mRNA profiling techniques including Lexogen QuantSeq, Qiagen QiaSeq, BioSpyder TempO-Seq, Ion AmpliSeq, Nanostring, Affymetrix Clariom S or U133A, Illumina BeadChip and Ion Total RNA-seq of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) and fresh frozen (FF) sequential patient-matched breast tumour samples. Results: The number of genes represented and reliability were found to vary between the platforms, but overall all methods provided data which were largely comparable. Crucially we found that it is possible to integrate data for combined analyses across FFPE/FF and platforms using established batch correction methods as required to increase cohort sizes. However, some platforms appear to be better suited to FFPE samples, particularly archival material. Overall, we illustrate that technology selection is a balance between required resolution, sample quality, availability and cost. Overall design: Sequencing of patient-matched sets of human breast cancer biopsy samples using 9 different mRNA profiling platforms. We assess the feasibility of integrating data from FFPE or FF tissue sequenced using different platforms and compare these different technoolgies."

Here we describe an approach to functionally validate these variants through the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to study cellular pathophysiology.  We collected peripheral blood cells from Framingham Heart Study participants and reprogrammed them to iPSCs.  We then differentiated 68 iPSC lines into hepatocytes and adipocytes to investigate the effect of the 1p13 rs12740374 variant on cardiometabolic disease phenotypes via transcriptomics and metabolomic signatures. We observed a clear association between rs12740374 and lipid accumulation and gene expression changes in differentiated hepatocytes, in particular expression of SORT1, CELSR2 and PSRC1, consistent with previous analysis of this variant using other approaches.  Initial investigation of additional SNPs also highlighted correlations with gene expression.  Thus, iPSC-based population studies seem promising for further development as a tool for the functional validation of GWAS variants.

The second goal was to examine effect of aerobic training on gene expression in muscle at baseline (after long term training). Seven untrained males performed the one-legged knee extension exercise (for 60 min) with the same relative intensity before and after a 2 month aerobic training programme (1 h/day, 5/week). Biopsy samples were taken at rest (baseline condition, 48 h after exercise), 1 and 4 h after the one-legged exercise from m. vastus lateralis of either leg. Comparison of gene expression in exercised leg with that in non-exercised [control] leg allowed us to identify contractile activity-specific genes in both untrained and trained skeletal muscle, i.e., genes that play a key role in adapting to acute exercise, regardless of the level of fitness. RNA-sequencing (84 samples in total; ~47 million reads/sample) was performed by NextSeq 500 and HiSeq 2500 (Illumina). Two months aerobic training increased the aerobic capacity of the knee-extensor muscles (power at anaerobic threshold in the incremental one-legged and cycling tests), the maximum rate of ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration in permeabilized muscle fibres and amounts of oxidative phosphorylation proteins. Contractile activity-specific changes in the transcriptome in untrained and trained human skeletal muscle were revealed for the first time. After 2 month aerobic training, transcriptome responses specific for contractile activity in trained muscle substantially decreased relative to those in untrained muscle. We found out that adaptation of skeletal muscle to regular exercise is associated not only with a transient change in the transcriptome after each stress (acute exercise), but also with a marked change in baseline expression of many genes after repeated stress (e.g., long term training). Overall design: Seven untrained males performed the one-legged knee extension exercise (for 60 min) with the same relative intensity (at ~65% of the maximal power determined in the one-legged knee extension ramp test) before and after a 2 month aerobic training programme (1 h/day, 5/week). Biopsy samples were taken at rest (baseline condition, 48 h after exercise), 1 and 4 h after the one-legged exercise from m. vastus lateralis of either leg. Comparison of gene expression in exercised leg with that in non-exercised leg allowed us to identify genes that are directly related to contractile activity in human skeletal muscle, regardless of the level of fitness as well as a change in baseline transcriptome after long term training.

The remaining high-risk families could be classified as BRCAX (non-BRCA1/2) families, in which no penetrant mutation has been found until now. Gene expression involving alternative splicing represents a well-known mechanism regulating the expression of multiple transcripts encoded by individual genes, which could be involved in cancer development. Thus using RNA-seq methodology, the analysis of transcriptome in immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines of high-risk breast cancer individuals could reveal transcripts implicated in breast cancer susceptibility and development. RNA was extracted from immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines of 117 women (affected and unaffected) coming from BRCA1, BRCA2 and BRCAX families. Anova analysis revealed a total of 95 transcripts corresponding to 85 different genes differentially expressed (Bonferroni corrected p-value <0.01) between those groups. Hierarchical clustering allowed distinctive subgrouping of BRCA1/2 subgroups from BRCAX individuals, without regard for the cancer status. We found enrichment for pathways in signaling cascades including mTOR and EIF2-related pathways. No transcripts were differentially expressed between BRCA1 and BRCA2 individuals, however out of 95 transcripts, 67 could discriminate BRCAX from combination of BRCA1 and BRCA2 individuals. On the other hand, 28 transcripts could discriminate affected from unaffected BRCAX individuals. These BRCAX-associated transcripts demonstrated enrichment in Telomere Extension by Telomerase and Double-Strand Break Repair by Non-Homologous End Joining mechanisms. To our knowledge, this represents the first study identifying transcripts differentially expressed in immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines coming from the major classes of mutation-related breast cancer subgroups, namely BRCA1, BRCA2 and BRCAX. Moreover, some transcripts could discriminate affected from unaffected BRCAX individuals, which could represent potential therapeutic targets for breast cancer treatment. Overall design: Immortalised lymphocytes cell lines (LCL) were made from 117 women. Those women were classified as BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCAX unaffected and BRCAX affected individuals. Each LCLs was sequenced once except for one sample for each group. The control group is represented by BRCAX unaffected individuals."

Analysis of these tags allowed us to identify genes and pathways which were associated with clinical symptoms both on human and parasite sides. Particularly, we observed characteristic expression changes in the human innate immune response pathway genes depending on severity of malaria. We also identified a group of transcription regulatory factors and signaling molecule genes which have positive or negative correlations between humans and Pfs. These genes may change their expression patterns to accommodate the respective organisms to mutually conflicting environments. Furthermore, it was possible to utilize the RNA-Seq data for genotyping of the parasites to identify possible drug resistant genetic variations.

The role of the humoral immune system in vaccine-induced protection is widely appreciated; however, our understanding of how antibody specificities relate to B cell function remains limited, due to the complexity of polyclonal antibody responses. To address this, we developed the Spec-seq framework, which allows for simultaneous monoclonal antibody (mAb) characterization and transcriptional profiling from the same single cell. Here, we present the first application of the Spec-seq framework, which we applied to human plasmablasts after influenza vaccination in order to characterize transcriptional differences governed by B cell receptor (BCR) isotype and vaccine reactivity. Our analysis did not find evidence of long-term transcriptional specialization between plasmablasts of different isotypes. However, we did find enhanced transcriptional similarity between clonally related B cells, as well as distinct transcriptional signatures ascribed by BCR vaccine recognition. These data suggest IgG and IgA vaccine positive plasmablasts are largely similar, whereas IgA vaccine negative cells appear to be transcriptionally distinct from conventional, terminally differentiated, antigen-induced peripheral blood plasmablasts. Overall design: 295 single cells passed our quality control filters and were included in our analysis."

This study demonstrates that progressive changes in expression of these genes can be used to approximate the histological grade of a liver biopsy. Furthermore, the relative progression profiles of these disease-responsive genes are shown to be distinct across patient biopsies. This observation suggests that there may be distinct biological processes that drive disease progression across individuals Overall design: This dataset contains transcriptomic profiles of 78 distinct human liver biopsies.  Of these, 6 are histologically normal, and 72 cover the full spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD activity score 0-6, fibrosis stage 0-4)."

We sought to develop more potent and selective Menin-MLL1 interaction inhibitors that are effective in vitro and in vivo to directly assess potential therapeutic opportunities. Structure-based design yielded the potent, highly selective and orally-bioavailable small molecule inhibitor VTP-50469. Human cell lines carrying MLL-rearrangements were highly sensitive and selectively responsive to treatment with VTP-50469. VTP-50469 displaced Menin from high molecular weight protein complexes and inhibited chromatin occupancy of MLL1 at select target genes. Loss of MLL1 binding led to specific changes in gene expression, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis. Mice engrafted with leukemia cells isolated from patients with either MLL-r AML or MLL-r ALL showed dramatic reductions of leukemia burden and prolonged survival when treated with VTP-50469. Remarkably, multiple mice engrafted with MLL-r ALL remained disease free greater than 1 year following cessation of treatment. Therefore, inhibition of the Menin-MLL1 interaction with VTP-50469 is highly effective in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of human MLL-r AML and MLL-r ALL which supports rapid translation of this approach to clinical trials. This submission represents the scRNAseq component of the study. Overall design: Single cell sequencing of full-length transcripts (scRNA-seq) was used to investigate molecular profiles of ALL PDX cells in response to VTP-50469 treatments for 28 days."

It is widely used in a number of applications studying various transcriptomes of cells and tissues. It is also being increasingly considered for a number of clinical applications, including expression profiling for diagnostics or alternative transcripts detection. However, RNA sequencing can be challenging in some situations, for instance due to low input quantities or degraded RNA samples. Several protocols have been proposed to overcome some of these challenges, and many are available as commercial kits. Here we perform a comprehensive testing of three recent commercial technologies for RNA-seq library preparation (Truseq, Smarter and Smarter Ultra-Low) on human reference tissue preparations, for standard (1ug), low (100 and 10 ng) and ultra-low (< 1 ng) input quantities, and for mRNA and total RNA, stranded or unstranded. We analyze the results using read quality and alignments metrics, gene detection and differential gene expression metrics. Overall, we show that the Truseq kit performs well at 100 ng input quantity, while the Smarter kit shows degraded performances for 100 and 10 ng input quantities, and that the Smarter Ultra-Low kit performs quite well for input quantities < 1 ng. All the results are discussed in details, and we provide guidelines for the selection of a RNA-seq library preparation kits by biologists. Overall design: RNA-seq profiles of Human Universal Reference Total RNA (Clontech) and Human Brain reference RNA (Ambion) were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2000 or 2500 sequencers."
"human","data_sources/sra","SRP164953",56,"Selective Disruption of Core Regulatory Transcription [RNA-seq]","Activation of identity determining transcription factors (TFs), or core regulatory TFs, is governed by cell-type specific enhancers, an important subset of these being super enhancers (SEs). This mechanism is distinct from constitutive expression of housekeeping genes. The characterization of drug-like small molecules to selectively inhibit core regulatory circuitry is of high interest for treatment of cancers, which are addicted to core regulatory TF function at SEs. Surprisingly, we find histone deacetylases (HDAC) to be an indispensable component of SE-driven transcription. While histone acetylation is a marker for active genes, over accumulation of acetylation selectively halts core regulatory transcription. We show this conundrum may in part be explained by a SE-specific need for resetting histones to maintain SE boundaries, to facilitate enhancer-promoter looping and high levels of transcription. Overall design: RNA-seq data for FP-RMS cells treated with various concentrations of various small molecules modulators of epigenetic processes."

Although metformin has been shown to modulate multiple biological pathways at the cellular level, these pleiotropic effects of metformin on the biology of human aging have not been studied. We studied ~70-year-old participants (n=14), in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in which they were treated with 6 weeks each of metformin and placebo. Following each treatment period, skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were obtained, and a mixed-meal challenge test was performed. As expected, metformin therapy lowered 2-hour glucose, insulin AUC, and insulin secretion compared to placebo. Using FDR<0.05, 647 genes were differentially expressed in muscle and 146 genes were differentially expressed in adipose tissue. Both metabolic and non-metabolic pathways were significantly influenced, including pyruvate metabolism and DNA repair in muscle and PPAR & SREBP signaling, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and collagen trimerization in adipose. While each tissue had, a signature reflecting its own function, we identified a cascade of predictive upstream transcriptional regulators, including mTORC1, MYC, TNF, TGFß1 and miRNA-29b, that may explain tissue-specific transcriptomic changes in response to metformin treatment. This study provides the first evidence that, in older adults, metformin has metabolic and non-metabolic effects linked to aging. These data can inform the development of biomarkers for the effects of metformin, and potentially other drugs, on key aging pathways. Key words: Aging, biguanides, gene expression, metabolism, upstream regulators Overall design: This study 'MILES: Metformin in Longevity Study'' (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02432287) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover study. 14 men and women aged 60 and older, with impaired glucose tolerance based on 75g Oral Glucose Tolerance Test completed the study. Following a screening visit, the study consisted of two randomly assigned 6-week treatment periods (metformin and placebo). Metformin was introduced at 500 mg twice daily, and increased incrementally to 2000 mg daily at the end of 2 weeks to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. At the end of each 6-week treatment period, skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose biopsies were obtained. The samples were immediately homogenized in Trizol, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C for subsequent mRNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using QIAGEN's RNeasy Mini kit. Samples showing minimal degradation, as measured by RIN > 7 were processed for library preparation and sequenced in two/three technical replicates using multiplexed 100bp paired-end sequencing on Illumina HiSeq2500. Raw sequence reads were preprocessed using WASP 3.0, and FastQC was used for quality control. The raw FASTQ files were trimmed for adapter sequences using Trim Galore! RSEM algorithm (v1.2.25) in conjunction with STAR aligner (v2.4.2a) were used to quantify the raw reads to GRCh38 build of the reference human genome with transcript annotations from GENCODE. The raw counts matrix was exported from RSEM to edgeR, normalized using TMM normalization and used for differential expression analysis."

However, the extent of fibroblast heterogeneity in human skin is unknown. Here, using a combination of spatial transcriptional profiling of human and mouse dermis and single cell transcriptional profiling of human dermal fibroblasts, we show that there are at least four distinct fibroblast populations in adult human skin. We define markers permitting prospective isolation of these cells and show that although marker expression is rapidly lost in culture, different fibroblast subpopulations retain distinct functionality in terms of Wnt signalling, T cell communication and the ability to support human epidermal reconstitution in organotypic culture. Furthermore, while some fibroblast subpopulations are spatially segregated, others are not. These findings have profound implications for normal wound healing and diseases characterized by excessive fibrosis, and suggest that ex vivo expansion or in vivo ablation of specific fibroblast subpopulations may have therapeutic applications.

First, IPSDM lost expression of pluripotency markers, had remarkably distinct gene expression profiles relative to precursor iPSCs, and had largely similar gene expression as HMDM. Second, macrophage polarization to M1 was associated with a dramatic change in the transcriptome; expression profiles of IPSDM- and HMDM-derived M1 lines were highly correlated with each other but much less so with their respective IPSDM and HMDM precursors. Third, M2-HMDM lines had limited difference in gene expression compared to their non-polarized precursors, likely due to the known M2-like phenotype of M-CSF differentiated macrophages and their similarity to the IL-4 derived M2 phenotype Finally, through RNA-Seq we identified many new genes modulated during polarization in both HMDM and IPSDM thus providing novel, and potentially regulatory, candidates that warrant further study.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that have the ability to   differentiate into various cell types, have been isolated from the stromal fraction of virtually all   tissues. However, little is known about the true identity of MSCs. MSC populations exhibit great   tissue-, location- and patient-specific variation in gene expression and are heterogeneous in cell   composition.   Methodology/Principal findings: Our aim was to analyze the dynamics of differentiation of two closely related stromal cell types,   adipose tissue-derived MSCs and dermal fibroblasts (FBs) along adipogenic, osteogenic and   chondrogenic lineages using multiplex RNA-seq technology. We found that undifferentiated   donor-matched MSCs and FBs are distinct populations that stay different upon differentiation   into adipocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes. The changes in lineage-specific gene expression   occur early in differentiation and persist over time in both MSCs and FBs. Further, MSCs and   FBs exhibit similar dynamics of adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation but different dynamics   of chondrogenic differentiation.  Conclusion: Our findings suggest that stromal stem cells including adipose-derived MSCs and dermal FBs   exploit different molecular mechanisms of differentiation to reach a common cell fate. The early   mechanisms of differentiation are lineage-specific and are similar for adipogenic and osteogenic   differentiation but are distinct for chondrogenic differentiation between MSCs and FBs.

This dataset highlights intratumoral heterogeneity with regards to the expression of de novo derived transcriptional modules and established subtype classifiers. Overall design: Operative specimens from five glioblastoma patients (MGH26, MGH28, MGH29, MGH30, MGH31) were acutely dissociated, depleted for CD45+ inflammatory cells and then sorted as single cells (576 samples). Population controls for each tumor were isolated by sorting 2000-10000 cells and processed in parallel (5 population control samples).

The enzymes that catalyze these activities are often contained within multiprotein complexes in nature.  Two such multiprotein complexes, the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) methyltransferase and the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeler have been reported to act in opposition to each other during development and homeostasis.  An imbalance in their activities induced by mutations/deletions in complex members (e.g. SMARCB1) has been suggested to be a pathogenic mechanism in certain human cancers.  Here we show that preclinical models of synovial sarcoma - a cancer characterized by functional SMARCB1 loss via its displacement from the SWI/SNF complex through the pathognomonic SS18-SSX fusion protein - display sensitivity to pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2, the catalytic subunit of PRC2.  Treatment with tazemetostat, a clinical-stage, selective and orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of EZH2 enzymatic activity reverses a subset of synovial sarcoma gene expression and results in concentration-dependent cell growth inhibition and cell death specifically in SS18-SSX fusion-positive cells in vitro.  Treatment of mice bearing either a cell line or two patient-derived xenograft models of synovial sarcoma leads to dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition with correlative inhibition of trimethylation levels of the EZH2-specific substrate, lysine 27 on histone H3.  These data demonstrate a dependency of SS18-SSX-positive, SMARCB1-deficient synovial sarcomas on EZH2 enzymatic activity and suggests the potential utility of EZH2-targeted drugs in these genetically defined cancers.

Although bulk transcriptomic studies of post-mortem tissue from patients with ASD have revealed convergence of disease pathology on common pathways1--including splicing of neuronal genes4, synaptic signaling, microglial and astrocyte reactivity—the cortical cell type-specific molecular pathologies of ASD are unclear. Here we utilized high-throughput single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of snap-frozen post-mortem brain tissue of patients with ASD compared with neurologically normal children and young adults to identify the most prominent ASD-associated molecular changes across three cortical regions. Our findings show that synaptic signaling of upper-layer excitatory neurons is especially affected in ASD.

However, clinical responses to currently available immunotherapeutic agents vary considerably, for which the molecular basis is unclear. To date, unbiased transcriptomic studies of CTLs in human cancers have been performed in whole tumors or cells obtained from peripheral blood or metastatic sites of heavily pre-treated patients. We performed global transcriptional profiling of CTLs in tumors and adjacent non-tumor tissue from treatment-naïve patients with early stage lung cancer to define the molecular features associated with robustness of anti-tumor immune responses. We observed major differences in the transcriptional program of tumor-infiltrating CTLs that are shared across tumor subtypes. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of genes in cell cycle, T cell receptor (TCR) activation and co-stimulation pathways, indicating tumor-driven expansion of presumed tumor antigen-specific CTLs. We also observed marked heterogeneity in the expression of molecules associated with TCR activation and immune checkpoints such as 4-1BB, PD1, TIM3, and their expression was positively correlated with the density of tumor-infiltrating CTLs. Interestingly, transcripts linked to tissue-resident memory cells (TRM), such as CD103, were enriched in tumors containing a high density of CTLs, and CTLs from CD103high tumors displayed features of enhanced cytotoxicity, implying better anti-tumor activity. In an independent cohort of 689 lung cancer patients, we confirmed that patients with CD103high (TRM rich) tumors survived significantly longer. In summary, we define the molecular fingerprint of tumor-infiltrating CTLs at the site of primary tumor and identify a number of novel targets that may be important in modulating the magnitude and specificity of anti-tumor immune responses in lung cancer. Overall design: Analysis of  purified populations of CD8 T cells (isolated from primary head and neck squamous cancer tumors from patients) at the transcriptomic level by RNA sequencing."

However, factors that modulate the transplacental transfer efficiency of maternal IgG that could be harnessed for maternal vaccine design remain largely undefined. HIV-infected women have impaired placental IgG transfer, yet the mechanism underlying this impaired transfer is unknown, presenting an opportunity to explore factors that contribute to the efficiency of placental IgG transfer. We measured the transplacental transfer efficiency of maternal HIV and other pathogen-specific IgG in historical U.S. (n=120) and Malawian (n=47) cohorts of HIV-infected mothers and their HIV58 exposed uninfected and HIV-infected infants. We then examined the role of maternal HIV disease progression, infant factors, placental Fc receptor expression, and IgG Fc region subclass and glycan signatures and their association with transplacental transfer efficiency of maternal antigen-specific IgG. We established 3 distinct phenotypes of placental IgG transfer efficiency in HIV-infected women, including: 1) efficient transfer of the majority of antigen-specific IgG populations; 2) generally poor IgG transfer phenotype that was strongly associated with maternal CD4+ T cell counts, hypergammaglobulinemia, and frequently yielded non-protective levels of vaccine-specific IgG; and 3) variable transfer of IgG across distinct antigen specificities. Interestingly, maternal IgG characteristics, such as binding to placentally expressed Fc receptors FcgRIIa and FcgRIIIa, IgG subclass frequency, and Fc region glycan profiles were associated with placental IgG transfer efficiency. These maternal IgG transplacental transfer determinants were distinct among different antigen-specific IgG populations. Our findings suggest that in HIV-infected women, both maternal disease progression and Fc region characteristics modulate the selective placental transfer of distinct IgG subpopulations, with implications for both the health of HIV-exposed uninfected infants and maternal vaccine design. Overall design: Placental biopsy samples from HIV-infected Malawian women were sequenced on a Nextseq500 sequencer (Illumina) using 75bp paired-end reads."

Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent T-cell stimulators; yet  despite DCs' extensive presence in skin, cutaneous T cells in CTCL do not respond with  effective anti-tumor immunity. We evaluated primary T-cell and DC émigrés from epidermal and  dermal explant cultures of skin biopsies from CTCL patients (n = 37) and healthy donors (n = 5).  Compared with healthy skin, CD4+ CTCL populations contained more T cells expressing PD-1,  CTLA-4, and LAG-3; and CD8+ CTCL populations comprised more T cells expressing CTLA-4  and LAG-3. CTCL populations also contained more T cells expressing the inducible T-cell  costimulator (ICOS), a marker of T-cell activation. DC émigrés from healthy or CTCL skin  biopsies expressed PD-L1, indicating that maturation during migration resulted in PD-L1  expression irrespective of disease. Most T cells did not express PD-L1. Using skin samples  from 49 additional CTCL patients for an unsupervised analysis of genome-wide mRNA  expression profiles corroborated that advanced T3/T4 stage samples expressed higher levels of  checkpoint inhibition genes compared with T1/T2 stage patients or healthy controls. Exhaustion  of activated T cells is therefore a hallmark of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells directly isolated from  the lesional skin of patients with CTCL, with a continuum of increasing expression in more  advanced stages of disease. These results justify identification of antigens driving T-cell  exhaustion and the evaluation of immune checkpoint inhibition to reverse T-cell exhaustion  earlier in the treatment of CTCL.

To validate the potential relevance of mouse models of targeting the Th17 pathway in human diseases we used RNA sequencing to compare the expression of coding and non-coding transcripts during the priming of Th17 cell differentiation in both human and mouse. In addition to already known targets, several transcripts not previously linked to Th17 cell polarization were found in both species. Moreover, a considerable number of human-specific long non-coding RNAs were identified that responded to cytokines stimulating Th17 cell differentiation. We integrated our transcriptomics data with known disease-associated polymorphisms and show that conserved regulation pinpoints genes that are relevant to Th17 cell-mediated human diseases and that can be modelled in mouse. Substantial differences observed in non-coding transcriptomes between the two species as well as increased overlap between Th17 cell-specific gene expression and disease-associated polymorphisms underline the need of parallel analysis of human and mouse models. Comprehensive analysis of genes regulated during Th17 cell priming and their classification to conserved and non-conserved between human and mouse facilitates translational research, pointing out which candidate targets identified in human are worth studying by using in vivo mouse models.

We investigated their epigenetic phenotype using high-throughput analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression.  METHODS: 17 SSA/Ps and, as a comparative group, 15 conventional adenomas (all with matched samples of normal mucosa) were prospectively collected during colonoscopy. DNA from the 64 tissues was analyzed, via bisulfite next generation sequencing, for methylation at ~2.7 million CpG sites located prevalently in gene regulatory regions spanning 80.5Mb (~2.5% of the genome). The transcriptome of these samples was also investigated using RNA sequencing. An independent series of 61 archival lesions was used for targeted verification of DNA methylation.  RESULTS: Both SSA/Ps and conventional adenomas showed a profound remodelling of their methylome. Cytosine hypermethylation was more pervasive in SSA/Ps than adenomas, in terms of number of hypermethylated regions (22,147 vs 15,965, respectively) and genes (4938 vs 3443, respectively). In addition, the extent of hypermethylation in a given region was higher in SSA/Ps than adenomas. This methylation pattern of SSA/Ps was reminiscent of the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) of their descendant cancers. We have called this phenotype proto-CIMP since most of the hypermethylation occurred in CpG islands and shores. SSA/Ps were also protected from a wave of demethylation that instead occurred in adenomas outside of CpG islands/shores (4288 vs 18,417 hypomethylated regions in SSAPs vs adenomas). Verification studies of six hypermethylated regions demonstrated the high potential of DNA methylation markers for predicting the diagnosis of SSA/Ps and/or adenomas. Proto-CIMP of SSA/Ps was surprisingly associated with a higher number of up- (618) than downregulated (349) genes, while adenomas showed the opposite trend (516 up- vs 712 downregulated genes). CONCLUSIONS: The epigenetic landscape of SSA/Ps differs substantially from that of conventional adenomas. This huge amount of epigenetic variation represents a rich source of promising diagnostic tools, such as novel DNA markers or histologic stainings, for the tailored management of the two most frequent colon cancer precursors."

Bromodomain and Extra Terminal (BET) proteins, including ubiquitously expressed BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and testis-specific BRDT, are epigenetic “readers” and play a major role in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. BET proteins have emerged as new therapeutic targets for human cancer and other diseases. Based upon a new class of BET bromodomain (BRD) inhibitor, BETi-211, we have developed a highly selective and potent BET protein degrader, BETd-246. In comparison, BETd-246 is much more potent and effective than the corresponding BET inhibitor BETi-211 in growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in TNBC cell lines, indicating critical differences between these two different BET targeting approaches in their regulation of gene transcription. To understand the mechanisms of actions of BETi-211 and BETd-246 in TNBC, we performed RNA-seq analysis on MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468. These cell lines were treated for 3 h to capture the early transcriptional responses to BETi-211 or BETd-246. RNA-seq analysis reveals that BETd-246 predominantly down-regulates the expression of a large number of genes whereas BETi-211 up- and down-regulates an approximately equal number of genes in TNBC cells. Critically, transcriptomic analysis uncovers that a set of proliferation and survival-related genes, including MCL1 and BRD2, were oppositely regulated by BETd-246 and BETi-211 in these TNBC cell lines. Overall design: Global gene transcription profiling was performed in MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines treated with DMSO, Thalidomide (1000 nmol/L), BETi-211 (1000 nmol/L) or BETd-246 (100 nmol/L) for 3 hours.

An imbalance between HAT and HDAC activities resulting in hyperacetylation of histones has been identified in COPD.  We hypothesized that BET inhibitor (JQ1) treatment of BET protein interactions with hyperacetylated sites in the chromatin will regulate excessive activation of pro-inflammatory genes and survival of key inflammatory drivers, alveolar macrophages (AM) in COPD. Transcriptome analysis of AM from COPD patients indicated up-regulation of macrophage type 1 genes upon LPS stimulation. BET inhibitor JQ1 treatment attenuated expression of multiple genes, including pro-inflammatory cytokines and regulators innate and adaptive immune cells. We demonstrated for the first time that JQ1 regulates differentially LPS-induced cytokine release from AM or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of COPD patients than PBMC of healthy controls. Using BET regulated gene signature, we identified a subset of COPD patients, which we propose to benefit from BET inhibition.  This work demonstrates that the effects of BET inhibition through JQ1 treatment of inflammatory cells has the potential to restore gene expression dysregulated in COPD patients vs healthy controls, and the expression of BET regulated genes is altered in COPD. The findings provide evidence of histone hyperacetylation as a mechanism driving chronic inflammatory changes in COPD. Overall design: Alveolar macrophages were incubated with JQ1 (10uM) for 1h at 37°C and subsequently challenged with 100ng/ml of LPS from E. coli (serotype 026:B6, Sigma) for 6h or 24 h at 37°C in CO2 incubator.

A comprehensive approach integrating RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq digital footprinting showed that TNF and type I IFNs extensively remodel chromatin states in human macrophages to differentially regulate transcriptional induction of NF-?B, STAT, antiviral, and metabolic genes by LPS. IFN-a potentiated TNF inflammatory function by abrogating feedback silencing of inflammatory genes via priming of chromatin to enable robust transcriptional responses to weak upstream signals. Similar chromatin regulation occurred in human diseases. Our findings provide insights into epigenomic mechanisms by which cytokines reprogram inflammatory responses, and identify new functions and mechanisms of action of TNF and IFNs.

Using RNAs extracted from peripheral blood of the patients as the mixture of the human and Pf transcripts, we generated a total of 3 billion RNA-Seq tags. Analysis of these tags allowed us to identify genes and pathways which were associated with clinical symptoms both on human and parasite sides. Particularly, we observed characteristic expression changes in the human innate immune response pathway genes depending on severity of malaria. We also identified a group of transcription regulatory factors and signaling molecule genes which have positive or negative correlations between humans and Pfs. These genes may change their expression patterns to accommodate the respective organisms to mutually conflicting environments. Furthermore, it was possible to utilize the RNA-Seq data for genotyping of the parasites to identify possible drug resistant genetic variations. By bypassing technical difficulty in preparing samples in field, this approach should provide a practically useful mean to describe mutually interacting transcritpomes of humans and parasites, which should eventually explain diverse malaria symptoms."

Using next-generation sequencing, we studied the expression of 772 GPCRs in 148 genetically diverse AML specimens, normal blood and bone marrow cell populations as well as cord blood-derived CD34-positive cells. Among these receptors, 30 are overexpressed and 19 are downregulated in AML samples compared with normal CD34-positive cells. Upregulated GPCRs are enriched in chemokine (CCR1, CXCR4, CCR2, CX3CR1, CCR7 and CCRL2), adhesion (CD97, EMR1, EMR2 and GPR114) and purine (including P2RY2 and P2RY13) receptor subfamilies.

Guanine (G)-rich sequences in RNA can assemble to form RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) structures; specific rG4s have been shown to regulate gene expression, and are associated with human diseases. However, no transcriptome-wide method has been reported to map rG4s, limiting our understanding of the rG4 structure and its relationship with function and regulation. Here we introduce a transcriptome-wide rG4 profiling method, rG4-Seq, in which the rG4-mediated reverse transcriptase stalling is read out by next-generation sequencing at nucleotide resolution. We apply this method to human RNA and report the first global map of rG4 structures for any organism. Our analysis identifies over 3,000 rG4s, and increases to over 11,000 upon addition of a rG4 stabilizing ligand Pyridostatin (PDS). Notably, we discover that besides canonical rG4s, many rG4s are non-canonical with novel structural features such as long-loops, bulges, and 2-quartet. We also find that rG4 formation is associated with its stability, Cytosine (C)-content, and the stability of alternative RNA structures. Our data reveals that rG4s can be found in messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs). In mRNAs, rG4s are enriched in untranslated regions, and are significantly correlated with microRNA target sites and polyadenylation signals. Remarkably, we found that majority of our in vitro identified rG4s can change the in silico predicted RNA structure to uncover alternative RNA conformation.. Futhermore, the rG4s that have analogues in many ortholog genes across different species show a preferential association with RNA processing and stability. rG4-seq is a broadly applicable method that enables the RNA G4 structurome and its biological roles to be interrogated and can be readily applied in other organisms on a transcriptome-wide scale.

However, evidence of probiotic gut mucosal colonization efficacy remains sparse and controversial. We metagenomically characterized the murine and human mucosal-associated gastrointestinal microbiome and found it to only partially correlate with stool microbiome. A sequential invasive multi-omics measurement at baseline and during consumption of an 11-strain probiotic combination or placebo, demonstrated that probiotics remain viable upon gastrointestinal passage. In colonized, but not germ-free mice, probiotics encountered a marked mucosal colonization resistance. In contrast, humans featured a person-, region- and microbial-specific mucosal colonization patterns, hallmarked by differential baseline host and microbiome features, but indistinguishable by probiotics presence in stool. Consequently, probiotics induced a transient, highly-individualized impact on mucosal community structure and gut transcriptome. Collectively, empiric probiotics supplementation may be limited in universally and persistently impacting the gut mucosa, meriting development of new personalized probiotic approaches.Abstract (2):Probiotics are widely prescribed for prevention of antibiotics-associated dysbiosis and related adverse effects. However, probiotic impact on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the gut mucosal host-microbiome niche remains elusive. We invasively examined the effects of multi-strain probiotics or autologous fecal microbiome transplantation (aFMT) on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the murine and human mucosal microbiome niche. Contrary to homeostasis, antibiotic perturbation enhanced probiotics colonization in the human mucosa, but only mildly improved colonization in mice. Compared to spontaneous recovery, probiotics induced a markedly delayed and persistently-incomplete indigenous stool/mucosal microbiome reconstitution and gut transcriptome recovery to steady-state configuration, while aFMT induced a rapid and near-complete recovery within days of administration. In-vitro, Lactobacillus-secreted soluble factors contributed to probiotics-induced microbiome inhibition. Collectively, potential post-antibiotic probiotic benefits may be offset by a compromised microbiome and host recovery, highlighting a need of developing aFMT or personalized probiotic approaches achieving mucosal protection, without compromising microbiome recolonization in the antibiotics-perturbed host."

Because CKI is a complex mixture of plant secondary metabolites, we used a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation and reconstitution approach to define chemical fractions required for CKI to induce apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Our initial fractionation separated major from minor compounds, and showed that the major compounds accounted for little of the activity of CKI. By systematically perturbing the major compounds in CKI we found that removal of no single major compound could alter the effect of CKI on cell viability and apoptosis. However, simultaneous removal of two major compounds identified oxymatrine and oxysophocarpine as critical compounds with respect to CKI activity. We then used RNA sequencing and transcriptome analysis to correlate compound removal with gene expression and phenotype data. We determined that many compounds in CKI are required for its effectiveness in triggering apoptosis but that significant modulation of its activity is conferred by a small number of compounds. In conclusion, CKI may be typical of many plant based extracts that contain many compounds in that no single compound is responsible for all of the bioactivity of the mixture and that many compounds interact in a complex fashion to influence a network containing many targets.

It consist of neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils, basophils and mast cells. Myelopoietic dysfunction or deregulation underlies numerous pathologies, ranging from immune deficiencies and allergies to myeloproliferative disorders and myeloid leukemia. To study malignant myelopoiesis, it is essential to understand the ontology of the different celltypes. In a generally accepted model for hematopoietic differentiation, all myeloid cells are preceded by a common granulocyte and macrophage progenitor that has the potential for all myeloid celltypes at the single cell level. However, we recently proposed a model for mouse hematopoiesis in which myeloid cells are formed via two independent pathways, one leading towards macrophages and neutrophils and one leading towards eosinophils, basophils and mast cells. The first pathway is affiliated with lymphoid potentials whereas the latter with megakaryocyte/erythroid development. Here, we demonstrate that those findings translate to human hematopoiesis. We demonstrate prospective isolation of myeloid progenitor cells that have restricted multipotent myeloid potential and are affiliated with lineages similar to those found in the mouse hierarchy.

Extensive rhythmic transcription was observed in human skeletal muscle in comparison to in vitro cell culture. However, nearly half of the in vivo rhythmicity was lost at the mRNA accumulation level. siRNA-mediated clock disruption in primary myotubes significantly affected the expression of ~8% of all genes, with impact on glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Genes involved in GLUT4 expression, translocation and recycling were negatively affected, whereas lipid metabolic genes were altered to promote activation of lipid utilization. Moreover, basal and insulin stimulated glucose uptake were significantly reduced upon CLOCK depletion.

Retinal differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) sources could provide a renewable source of cone photoreceptors towards developing a cone cell replacement therapy to treat blindness. Demonstration of comparable gene expression profiles between human foetal and stem cell-derived cones at equivalent stages is required to progress the cell transplantation approach into the patient, as it is hypothesised stem cell-derived cones are required to show high levels of developmental recapitulation of the in vivo generated cones. In this study, the AAV2/9.pR2.1.GFP reporter was used to specifically label L/M-opsin cone photoreceptors in human foetal retinal samples, obtained from the MRC-Wellcome Trust Human Developmental Biology Resource, at a range of developmental stages. The L/M-opsin cone population represent the majority cone cell types in the adult human retina and are the only photoreceptors present within the fovea. Using fluorescence activated cell sorting, L/M-opsin GFP+ cones and GFP- retinal populations, alongside total foetal retinal samples containing all retinal cell tytpes, were isolated and processed for bulk RNA sequencing and downstream comparative analysis. Using DESeq2 differential gene expression analyses, statistically significant genes enriched within the GFP+ human foetal LM-opsin cone populations were determined which led to the identification of a cone enriched gene signature of human L/M-opsin cone photoreceptors. The AAV2/9.pR2.1.GFP reporter was applied to hiPSC-derived retinal cultures to isolate and process cone-like cell populations for RNA sequencing using the same strategy developed within the human foetal retina. Applying the cone enriched gene signature to the transcriptome of hiPSC-derived GFP+ samples at equivalent developmental stages revealed some expression similarities in genes found to be enriched within the late foetal L/M-opsin cone photoreceptors.

Dynamic aRME affected a considerable portion of the transcriptome, with levels dependent on the cell’s transcriptional activity, but clonal aRME was surprisingly scarce (<1% of genes) and affected mainly lowly expressed genes. Consequently, the overwhelming portion of aRME occurs transiently and is scattered throughout somatic populations rather than, as previously hypothesized, confined to spatially restricted patches of clonally related cells.

RNAseq is superior to microarray to determine DEGs because it’s not limited to available probes, has increased sensitivity, and detects alternative and previously unknown transcripts. DEGs were determined in adult kidney recipients, without clinical acute rejection (AR), treated with antibody induction, calcineurin inhibitor, mycophenolate, with and without steroids. Blood was obtained pre-transplant (baseline), week 1, months 3 and 6 post-transplant. PBMCs were isolated, RNA extracted and gene expression measured using RNAseq. Principal components (PCs) were computed using a surrogate variable approach. DEGs post-transplant were identified by controlling false discovery rate (FDR) at < 0.01 with at least a 2 fold change in expression from pre-transplant. The top 5 DEGs with higher levels of transcripts in blood at week 1 were TOMM40L, TMEM205, OLFM4, MMP8, and OSBPL9 compared to baseline. The top 5 DEGs with lower levels at week 1 post-transplant were IL7R, KLRC3, CD3E, CD3D, and KLRC2(Striking Image) compared to baseline. The top pathways from genes with lower levels at 1 week post-transplant compared to baseline, were T cell receptor signaling and iCOS-iCOSL signaling while the top pathways from genes with higher levels than baseline were axonal guidance signaling and LXR/RXR activation. Gene expression signatures at month 3 were similar to week 1. DEGs at 6 months post-transplant create a different gene signature than week 1 or month 3 post-transplant. RNAseq analysis identified more DEGs with lower than higher levels in blood compared to baseline at week 1 and month 3. The number of DEGs decreased with time post-transplant. Further investigations to determine the specific lymphocyte(s) responsible for differential gene expression may be important in selecting and personalizing immune suppressant drugs and may lead to targeted therapies.

However, clinical responses to currently available immunotherapeutic agents vary considerably, for which the molecular basis is unclear. To date, unbiased transcriptomic studies of CTLs in human cancers have been performed in whole tumors or cells obtained from peripheral blood or metastatic sites of heavily pre-treated patients. We performed global transcriptional profiling of CTLs in tumors and adjacent non-tumor tissue from treatment-naïve patients with early stage lung cancer to define the molecular features associated with robustness of anti-tumor immune responses. We observed major differences in the transcriptional program of tumor-infiltrating CTLs that are shared across tumor subtypes. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of genes in cell cycle, T cell receptor (TCR) activation and co-stimulation pathways, indicating tumor-driven expansion of presumed tumor antigen-specific CTLs. We also observed marked heterogeneity in the expression of molecules associated with TCR activation and immune checkpoints such as 4-1BB, PD1, TIM3, and their expression was positively correlated with the density of tumor-infiltrating CTLs. Interestingly, transcripts linked to tissue-resident memory cells (TRM), such as CD103, were enriched in tumors containing a high density of CTLs, and CTLs from CD103high tumors displayed features of enhanced cytotoxicity, implying better anti-tumor activity. In an independent cohort of 689 lung cancer patients, we confirmed that patients with CD103high (TRM rich) tumors survived significantly longer. In summary, we define the molecular fingerprint of tumor-infiltrating CTLs at the site of primary tumor and identify a number of novel targets that may be important in modulating the magnitude and specificity of anti-tumor immune responses in lung cancer. Overall design: Analysis of  purified populations of CD8 T cells (isolated from primary lung tumors and matched adjacent lung tissue of lung cancer patients) at the transcriptomic level by RNA sequencing."

As such it provides new insights into how the mucosal immune response controls gut function in general.","Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), the most frequently occurring form ofsymptomatic immunodeficiency, is a heterogeneous disease that is most likely due to manydifferent genetic defects. In recent years, some of these have been described, but the vastmajority of patients with CVID are still without a defined genetic abnormality (ref).With the advent of early gamma globulin replacement therapy, CVID patients are relativelyfree from life-threatening infections and have a more prolonged survival (REF). The latter,however, has revealed that CVID can be associated with other problems not due tocommon infectious agents. One of these, CVID enteropathy is characterized by villousatrophy, malabsorption and diarrhea and occurs in up to 25% of CVID patients insymptomatic form and perhaps in a larger percentage in asymptomatic form (PMID:20551941; other ref). It is not clear why only a subset of patients with CVID developenteropathy since this manifestation of the disease has not been coupled to a particulargenetic defect or environmental exposure.The villous atrophy accompanying CVID enteropathy is histologically similar to that in celiacdisease and, as such, is characterized by lamina propria inflammation accompanied bypolymorphonuclear cell infiltration and increased numbers of intra-epithelial lymphocytes;however, the prominent plasma cell infiltration seen in celiac disease is not present (PMID:20551941). These studies also showed that intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in CVIDenteropathy differed from those in celiac disease in regarding some natural killer cellmarkers and TCR?/? characteristic of those in celiac disease were generally not present inCVID. Further, studies of the immunologic features of this gastrointestinal syndromeconducted by Mannon et al. (PMID: 16952544) revealed that lamina propria cells wereproducing increased amounts of IL-12 and IFN-? but little if any IL-17.In previous studies we have shown using systems biology methodology that totalimmunoglobulin and IgA deficiency in mice or indeed CVID in humans is associated with aremarkable up-regulation of interferon-inducible genes accompanied by a down-regulationof GATA4-related metabolic genes in the gut epithelium (PMID: 22101768). Since thesechanges were not seen in germ-free mice it clearly implied that they were dependent onone or more organisms in the gut microbiota. These studies therefore suggested that thepathogenesis of CVID enteropathy may be related to the presence of an immune defect thatleads to the colonization with an organism that drives these multiple gene expressionchanges. In the present study, we have again applied a systems biology approach to addressthis possibility, in this case including human transcriptome and microbiome analyses ofduodenal tissues of patients and healthy controls. To our surprise, we found that CVIDenteropathy was strictly limited to those CVID patients with vanishing low gut tissue IgAlevels irrespective of accompanying gut IgG levels and serum IgA levels. We used this globalomics data for transkingdom network analysis (PMID: 25614621;) to identify candidatebacteria capable of inducing the interferons response causing the villous atrophy andmalabsorption. Lastly, also using gene expression network of CVID enteropathy we pinpointand later validated in vitro two immune genes that mediate inhibitory effect of interferonson lipid metabolism in epithelium."

While effective genetic approaches have been developed in vitro and in animal models, these cannot be used to interrogate human physiology in vivo. Instead, naturally occurring somatic mutations have been utilized to infer clonality and lineal relationships between cells in human tissues, but current approaches are limited by high error rates and scale, and provide little information about the state or function of the cells. Here, we show how somatic mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can be tracked by current single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) or single cell ATAC-Seq (scATAC-Seq) for simultaneous analysis of single cell lineage and state. We leverage somatic mtDNA mutations as natural genetic barcodes and demonstrate their use as clonal markers to infer lineal relationships. We trace the lineage of human cells by somatic mtDNA mutations in a native context both in vitro and in vivo, and relate it to expression profiles and chromatin accessibility. Our approach should allow lineage tracing at a 100- to 1,000-fold greater scale than with single cell whole genome sequencing, while providing information on cell state, opening the way to chart detailed cell lineage and fate maps in human health and disease.

To overcome this challenge, and to minimize variations in gene expression due to individual variation, here we perform single-cell RNA-seq to compare expression profiles of CMLSCs and HSCs isolated from the same patient. We captured ~600 HSCs (CD34+CD38-CD90+CD45RA-) (~200 from each of three CML patient samples), separated them into CMLSCs (BCR-ABL+) or normal HSCs (BCR-ABL-) based on the presence of the BCR-ABL transcript, and performed paired-end deep sequencing. Typically, we obtained ~2.5 million mapped reads (>70% average mapping efficiency) and detected ~5,000 genes (transcript per million [TPM]>1) per cell. Despite the heterogeneity of the gene expression pattern, we were able to identify genes that were significantly more highly expressed in CMLSCs than in normal HSCs. Notably, among these genes are two cell surface markers, CD33 and CD47, that could potentially be used to distinguish CMLSCs from normal HSCs. We also found genes, such as PIM2, that could be targeted for CML therapy using available small molecule inhibitors. Overall design: Hematopoietic stem cell population from three chronic phase CML patients with no detectable BCR-ABL mutation."

The vast majority of stage M patients present with disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in the bone marrow (BM). Although these cells represent a major obstacle in the treatment of neuroblastoma patients, their transcriptomic profile was not intensively analyzed so far. Results: RNA-Seq of stage M primary tumors, enriched BM-derived DTCs and the corresponding non-tumor mononuclear cells (MNCs) revealed that DTCs largely retained the gene expression signature of tumors. However, we identified 322 genes that were differentially expressed (q < 0.001, |log2FC|>2). Particularly genes encoded by mitochondrial DNA were highly up-regulated in DTCs, whereas e.g. genes involved in angiogenesis were down-regulated. Furthermore, 224 genes were highly expressed in DTCs and only slightly, if at all, in MNCs (q < 8x10-75 log2FC > 6). Interestingly, we found that the gene expression profiles of diagnostic DTCs largely resembled those of relapse DTCs with only 113 differentially expressed genes under relaxed cut-offs (q < 0.01, |log2FC| > 0.5). Notably, relapse DTCs showed a positional enrichment of 31 down-regulated genes encoded by chromosome 19, including five tumor suppressor genes (SIRT6, PUMA, STK11, CADM4 and GLTSCR2).  Conclusion: This first RNA-Seq analysis of DTCs from neuroblastoma patients revealed their unique expression profile in comparison to the corresponding MNCs and tumor samples, and, interestingly, also expression differences between diagnostic and relapse DTCs preferentially affecting chromosome 19. As these alterations might be associated with treatment failure and disease relapse, they should be considered for further functional studies.

Expression of PD-L1 measured by immunohistochemistry has limited capacity for predicting outcomes of immune checkpoint therapy because expression of this biomarker does not correlate highly with treatment response. In addition, PD-L1 as measured on tumor cells, which has been approved by the FDA for both companion and complementary diagnostic utility, does not necessarily reflect anti-tumor activity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Results presented in this report demonstrate that gene expression levels of four interferon gamma (IFN?)-inducible mRNAs correlate with improved clinical outcomes in patients with NSCLC or UC treated with the PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab. This IFN? gene signature may augment the predictive value of PD-L1 and other biomarkers in identifying cancer patients most likely to respond to therapy with durvalumab or other immune checkpoint inhibitors. Overall design: RNA sequencing of 97  biopsies from a nonrandomized phase 1b/2 clinical trial (1108/NCT01693562) were profiled to identify a predictive signature; 62 locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (UC) tumors from the same study were profiled to confirm predictive utility of the signature."

The impact of injury pattern on the molecular biology of the injured ACL is unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the biological response of the ACL to injury varies based on the presence or absence of concomitant meniscus tear. RNA-seq analysis was performed on 28 ACL tears remnants (12 isolated, 16 combined). 16,654 transcripts were differentially-expressed between isolated and combined injury groups at false-discovery-rate of 0.05. Due to the large number of differentially expressed transcripts, we undertook an Ensembl approach to discover features that acted as hub-genes that did not necessarily have large fold-changes or high statistical significance, but instead had high biological significance. Our data revealed a negatively-correlated turquoise-module containing 5960 transcripts (down-regulated in combined injury) and a positively-correlated blue-module containing 2260 transcripts (up-regulated in combined injury). TNS1, MEF2D, NOTCH3, SOGA1, and MLXIP were highly-connected hub-genes in the turquoise-module and SCN2A, CSMD3, LRC44, USH2A, and LRP1B were critical hub-genes in the blue-module. Transcripts in the turquoise-module were associated with biological-adhesion, actin-filament organization, cell-junction assembly, and cell-matrix adhesion. The blue-module transcripts were enriched for neuron-migration and exocytosis-regulation. These findings indicate a loss of healing and gain of neurogenic signaling in combined ACL and meniscus tears, suggesting they have diminished potential for repair. The biological response of the ACL to injury could have implications for the healing potential of the ligament and the long-term health of the knee. Overall design: RNA isolated from ACL remnants was subjected to RNA-seq to study gene transcripts differentially expressed between isolated (ACL injury only) and combined (ACL + meniscus injury) groups."

In breast cancer, approximately one-fifth of metastatic patients survive 5 years. Therefore, detecting the patients at a high risk of developing distant metastasis at first diagnosis is critical for effective treatment strategy. We conducted comprehensive genetic analyses to discover driver mutations escalating the risk of metastasis, using Exome and RNA sequencing of the samples of 22 HRM (high-risk for distant metastasis) and 56 LRM (low-risk for distant metastasis) breast cancer patients. We hypothesized that the genetic mutations responsible for the metastasis may be associated with TFs (transcription factors) to perturb the downstream processes which result in DEGs (differentially expressed genes). Based on this, we developed a new integrated systematic approach to predict candidate driver mutations by measuring the sample coverage and the weight of the pathways linking mutations to TFs. The analysis led to the discovery of HRM-specific mutations in ADPGK, NUP93, PCGF6, PKP2, and SLC22A5 which significantly enhanced cancer cell migration and metastatic signaling pathways. The discovered somatic mutations may be useful for identifying patients who are likely to develop distant metastasis. Furthermore, our integrative systematic analyses suggest a new way to discover and understand driver mutations without relying on simple frequency-based analyses."

Here we report that 12 weeks of high-intensity aerobic interval (HIIT), resistance (RT), and combined exercise training enhanced insulin sensitivity and lean mass, but only HIIT and combined training improved aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration. HIIT revealed a more robust increase in gene transcripts than other exercise modalities, particularly in older adults, although little overlap with corresponding individual protein abundance was noted. HIIT reversed many age-related differences in the proteome, particularly of mitochondrial proteins in concert with increased mitochondrial protein synthesis. Both RT and HIIT enhanced proteins involved in translational machinery irrespective of age. Only small changes of methylation of DNA promoter regions were observed. We provide evidence for predominant exercise regulation at the translational level, enhancing translational capacity and proteome abundance to explain phenotypic gains in muscle mitochondrial function and hypertrophy in all ages. Overall design: The prospective exercise training study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov (#NCT01477164) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided informed written consent. Participants were recruited into two distinct age groups: young (18–30 years) or older (65–80 years) with a goal of an equal number of men and women.

Here we show that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor that senses environmental stimuli, modulates pathology in psoriasis. AhR-activating ligands reduced inflammation in the lesional skin of psoriasis patients, whereas AhR antagonists upregulated inflammation. Similarly, AhR signaling via the endogenous FICZ ligand reduced the inflammatory response in the imiquimod-induced model of psoriasis and AhR deficient mice exhibited a substantial exacerbation of the disease, compared to AhR sufficient controls. Non-haematopoietic cells, in particular keratinocytes, were responsible for this hyper-inflammatory response, which involved increased reactivity to IL-1beta and upregulation of AP-1 family members of transcription factors. Thus, our data suggest a critical role for AhR in the regulation of inflammatory responses and open the possibility for novel therapeutic strategies in chronic inflammatory disorders.

Therefore, we performed a comprehensive RNA-Seq analysis of laser-microdissected melanocytic nevi (n=23) and primary melanoma samples (n=57) and characterized the molecular mechanisms of early melanoma development. Using self-organizing maps, unsupervised clustering and analysis of pseudotime (PT) dynamics to identify evolutionary trajectories, we describe here two transcriptomic types of melanocytic nevi (N1 and N2) and primary melanomas (M1 and M2). N1/M1 lesions are characterized by pigmentation-type and MITF gene signatures, and a high prevalence of NRAS mutations in M1 melanomas. N2/M2 lesions are characterized by inflammatory-type and AXL gene signatures with an equal distribution of wild type and mutated BRAF and low prevalence of NRAS mutations in M2 melanomas. Interestingly, N1 nevi and M1 melanomas and N2 nevi and M2 melanomas, respectively, cluster together, but there is no clustering in a stage-dependent manner. Transcriptional signatures of M1 melanomas harbour signatures of BRAF/MEK inhibitor resistance and M2 melanomas harbour signatures of anti-PD-1 antibody treatment resistance. Transcriptomic signatures suggest that the epigenetic regulators SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 are differentially involved in the epigenetic programming of the two melanoma types. Pseudotime dynamics of nevus and melanoma samples reflect a switch-like immune-escape mechanism in melanoma development with downregulation of immune genes paralleled by an increasing expression of a cell cycle signature in late-stage melanomas. Taken together, the transcriptome analysis identifies gene signatures and mechanisms underlying development of melanoma in early and late stages with relevance for diagnostics and therapy. Overall design: RNA-Seq analysis of laser-microdissected melanocytic nevi and primary melanoma samples. Some Melanoma samples are NRAS and/or BRAF mutated."

They thus provide an unmatched opportunity for characterising the developmental programme of pluripotency in Homo sapiens. Here we confirm that naïve PSC do not respond directly to germ layer induction, but must first acquire competence. Capacitation for multi-lineage differentiation occurs without exogenous growth factor stimulation and is facilitated by inhibition of Wnt signalling. Whole transcriptome profiling during this formative transition highlights dynamic changes in gene expression, affecting many cellular properties, including metabolism and epithelialisation. Notably, naïve pluripotency factors are exchanged for post-implantation factors, but competent cells remain devoid of lineage primed transcription. The gradual pace of transition for human naïve PSC is consistent with the timespan of primate development from blastocyst to gastrulation. Transcriptome trajectory during in vitro capacitation of human naïve cells tracks the progression of epiblast during embryogenesis in Macaca fascicularis, but shows greater divergence from mouse development. Thus the formative transition of naïve PSC in a simple culture system may recapitulate essential and specific features of pluripotency dynamics during an inaccessible period of human embryogenesis. Overall design: 2 lines of human naïve pluripotent stem cells (embryo-derived HNES1 and chemically reset cR-H9-EOS) were cultured in N2B27 and 2uM XAV939 for 10 days. After that the cells were split into two conditions: N2B27 + 2uM XAV939 + 3ng/ml Activin A + 10ng/ml FGF2 (XAF), or E8 medium, for extended maintenance. The experiment was performed in biological triplicates for each cell line. RNAseq was performed with the cells on day 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, when the cells were cultured in XAV939; and one time point after transfer to maintenance conditions, at not less than 22 days of culture from the start of the experiment. Conventional hES cell line H9-EOS, which was a parental line for the chemically reset cR-H9-EOS was used as a control (in biological triplicate)."

Using the increased sensitivity and accuracy of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) for detecting and quantifying mRNA transcripts, our study has demonstrated novel significant differences in GEPs between MDS and normal CD34+ marrow cells with 41 genes identified as disease classifiers. Additionally, two main clusters of GEPs distinguished patients based on their major clinical features, particularly between those whose disease remained stable (sMDS) vs patients whose illness transformed to acute myeloid leukemia within 12 months (tMDS). The genes whose expression was associated with disease outcome were involved in functional pathways and biologic processes highly relevant for MDS. Exomic analysis identified MDS-associated pathogenic mutations in virtually all patients tested. MDS subgroups with spliceosome mutations demonstrated distinct differential isoform usage and expression and consequent dysregulation of distinct biological functions. This combination of clinical, transcriptomic and exomic findings provides valuable molecular insights into the mechanisms underlying MDS and its progression to a more aggressive stage and also facilitates prognostic characterization of MDS patients. Overall design: RNA-Seq was performed on CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells derived from healthy individuals and patients with myelodysplastic syndrome."

Over 82% of the genes and almost 75% of the transcripts detected as differentially expressed in KTCN and non-KTCN corneas were confirmed in the replication study using another set of samples. We used these differentially expressed genes to generate a network of KTCN-deregulated genes. We found an extensive disruption of collagen synthesis and maturation pathways, as well as downregulation of the core elements of the TGF-ß, Hippo, and Wnt signaling pathways influencing corneal organization. We identified long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and conducted a computational analysis of their potential functions, and found that lncRNAs regulated the processing and expression of the aforementioned genes. This first comprehensive transcriptome profiling of human KTCN corneas points further to a complex etiology of KTCN.

Optogenetic control of cells is achieved by coupling genetically encoded photoreceptors to cellular effectors and enables unprecedented spatiotemporal control of signaling processes. Here, a fast and reversibly switchable photoreceptor is used to tune the mechanical properties of polymer materials in a fully reversible, wavelength-specific, and dose- and space-controlled manner. By integrating engineered cyanobacterial phytochrome 1 into a polyethylene glycol matrix, hydrogel materials responsive to light in the cell-compatible red/far-red spectrum are synthesized. These materials are applied to study in human mesenchymal stem cells how different mechano-signaling pathways respond to changing mechanical environments, and to control the migration of primary immune cells in 3D. This optogenetics-inspired matrix allows addressing fundamental questions of how cells react to dynamic mechanical environments. Further, remote control of such matrices could create new opportunities for tissue engineering or provide a basis for optically stimulated drug depots.

Previous transcriptomic studies investigating the mechanisms of PTSD apply targeted approaches to identify individual genes under a cross-sectional framework lack a holistic view of the behaviours and properties of these genes at the system-level. Here we sought to apply an unsupervised gene-network based approach to a prospective experimental design using whole-transcriptome RNA-Seq gene expression from peripheral blood leukocytes of U.S. Marines (N=188), obtained both pre- and post-deployment to conflict zones. We identified discrete groups of co-regulated genes (i.e., co-expression modules) and tested them for association to PTSD. We identified one module at both pre- and post-deployment containing putative causal signatures for PTSD development displaying an over-expression of genes enriched for functions of innate-immune response and interferon signalling (Type-I and Type-II). Importantly, these results were replicated in a second non-overlapping independent dataset of U.S. Marines (N=96), further outlining the role of innate immune and interferon signalling genes within co-expression modules to explain at least part of the causal pathophysiology for PTSD development. A second module, consequential of trauma exposure, contained PTSD resiliency signatures and an over-expression of genes involved in hemostasis and wound responsiveness suggesting that chronic levels of stress impair proper wound healing during/after exposure to the battlefield while highlighting the role of the hemostatic system as a clinical indicator of chronic-based stress. These findings provide novel insights for early preventative measures and advanced PTSD detection, which may lead to interventions that delay or perhaps abrogate the development of PTSD. We used RNA-Sequencing gene expression to characterize both prognostic and diagnostic molecular signatures associated to PTSD risk and PTSD status compared to control subjects. Overall design: Peripheral blood luekocytes gene expression was subject to transcriptional analysis for 94 service members both prior-to and following-deployment to conflict zones. Half of the subjects returned with Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), while the other half did not."

Identifying the causative pathogen as quickly as possible is crucial to initiate the most optimal therapy, as acute bacterial meningitis is associated with a significant morbidity and mortality. Bacterial meningitis requires antibiotics, as opposed to enteroviral meningitis, which only requires supportive therapy. Clinical presentation is usually not sufficient to differentiate between viral and bacterial meningitis, thereby necessitating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis by PCR and/or time-consuming bacterial cultures. However, collecting CSF in children is not always feasible and a rather invasive procedure. Methods: In 12 Belgian hospitals, we obtained acute blood samples from children with signs of meningitis (49 viral and 7 bacterial cases). (aged between 3 months and 16 years). After pathogen confirmation on CSF, the patient was asked to give a convalescent sample after recovery. 3'mRNA sequencing was performed to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to create a host transcriptomic profile. Results: Enteroviral meningitis cases displayed the largest upregulated fold change enrichment in type I interferon production, response and signaling pathways. Patients with bacterial meningitis showed a significant upregulation of genes related to macrophage and neutrophil activation. We found several significantly DEGs between enteroviral and bacterial meningitis. Random forest classification showed that we were able to differentiate enteroviral from bacterial meningitis with an AUC of 0.982 on held-out samples. Conclusions: Enteroviral meningitis has an innate immunity signature with type 1 interferons as key players. Our classifier, based on blood host transcriptomic profiles of different meningitis cases, is a possible strong alternative for diagnosing enteroviral meningitis. Overall design: Gene expression profiles of host blood can be used to differentiate between different types of meningitis.  Libraries were sequenced in 4 lanes and each sequencing lane is represented as a column in the processed data files."

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP068970",404,"Loss of CSL unlocks a hypoxic response and enhanced tumor growth potential in breast cancer cells","Notch signaling is an important regulator of stem cell differentiation. All canonical Notch signaling is transmitted through the DNA-binding protein CSL and hyperactivated Notch signaling is associated with tumor development; thus it may be anticipated that CSL deficiency should reduce tumor growth. In contrast, we report that genetic removal of CSL in breast tumor cells caused accelerated growth of xenografted tumors. Loss of CSL unleashed a hypoxic response during normoxic conditions, manifested by stabilization of the HIF1± protein and acquisition of a polyploid giant-cell, cancer stem cell-like, phenotype. At the transcriptome level, loss of CSL upregulated more than 1750 genes and less than 3% of those genes were part of the Notch transcriptional signature. Collectively, this suggests that CSL exerts functions beyond serving as the central node in the Notch signaling cascade and reveals a novel role for CSL in tumorigenesis and regulation of the cellular hypoxic response. Overall design: CSL +/+ and CSL -/- MDA-MB-231 were subjected to Notch activation/inhibition and xenograft experiment. Total RNA were extracted from the samples and sent to NGS.

Mouse models  with mutations in known causal genes only partially recapitulate the phenotypes and are  therefore not unlimitedly suited for understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms  responsible for these conditions. Here we study periventricular heterotopia (PH) by analyzing  cerebral organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells of patients with mutations in  the cadherin receptor-ligand pair DCHS1 and FAT4 or from isogenic knock-out lines. Our  results show that human cerebral organoids reproduce the cortical heterotopia associated with  PH. Mutations in DCHS1 and FAT4 or knock-down of their expression cause changes in the  morphology of neural progenitor cells and result in defective neuronal migration dynamics  only in a subset of neurons. Single-cell RNA-sequencing data reveal a subpopulation of  mutant neurons with dysregulated genes involved in axon guidance, neuronal migration and  patterning. We suggest that defective neural progenitor cell (NPC) morphology and an altered  navigation system in a subset of neurons underlie this form of periventricular heterotopia. Overall design: Single cell transcriptomes from human control and mutant organoids were analyzed in this study. Mutant organoids were generated from patient-derived iPSCs and carry mutations in the cadherin receptor-ligand pair DCHS1 and FAT4.

Stepwise RNA-seq data from this model shows that in the context of AML driven by the MLL-AF9 (MA9) oncogene, the genetic background of the donor does not have a detectable effect. Comparison of these model leukemias from multiple single donors to AML patient samples containing MA9 translocations revealed conserved gene expression patterns not previously highlighted in this genetic sub-type.

Here we demonstrate that Drosophila embryos expressing catalytically deficient Trr eclose and develop to productive adulthood. Parallel experiments with a trr allele that augments enzyme product specificity show that conversion of H3K4me1 at enhancers to H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 is also compatible with life and results in minimal changes in gene expression. Similarly, loss of the catalytic SET domains of MLL3 and MLL4 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) does not disrupt selfrenewal. Drosophila embryos with trr alleles encoding catalytic mutants manifest subtle developmental abnormalities when subjected to temperature stress or altered cohesin levels. Collectively, our findings suggest that animal development can occur in the context of Trr or mammalian COMPASS-like proteins deficient in H3K4 monomethylation activity and point to a possible role for H3K4me1 on cis-regulatory elements in specific settings to fine-tune transcriptional regulation in response to environmental stress. Overall design: ChIP-seq and RNA-seq experiments were conducted in Drosophila wing imaginal discs and adult brain tissues from transgenic flies expressing either a catalytic-deficient (Trr-C2398A) or catalytic-hyperactive (Trr-Y2383F) Trr enzyme.

To stratify different subpopulations, we conduct transcriptome profiling of 144 single LNCaP prostate cancer cells treated and untreated with androgen after cell cycle synchronization. At least eight subpopulations of LNCaP cells are identified, revealing a previously unappreciable level of cellular heterogeneity to androgen stimulation. One subpopulation displays stem-like features, the advanced growth of which depends more on enhanced expression of 10 cell cycle-related genes and less on androgen-dependent signaling. Concordant upregulation of these genes appears to be linked to recurrent prostate cancers and can be used for early detection of tumors that subsequently develop androgen independence. Moreover, this single-cell approach provides a better understanding of how cancer cells respond heterogeneously to androgen-deprivation therapies and to reveal which subpopulations are resistant to this treatment. Overall design: For each of 3 treatment groups, forty eight LNCaP single cells and 1 representative bulk cell RNA sample (1ng) were collected for SMART-seq2 amplification and later single-cell RNA-seq (total 144 single cells and 3 bulk cell samples).

In this study, carbon tracing and systems biology approaches integrating metabolomic and transcriptomic profiling data were used to identify adaptations in human T cell metabolism important for fueling pro-inflammatory T cell function. Results of this study demonstrate that T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation leads to a significant increase in glucose and amino acid metabolism that trigger downstream biosynthetic processes. Specifically, increased expression of several enzymes such as CTPS1, IL4I1, and ASL results in the reprogramming of amino acid metabolism. Additionally, the strength of TCR signaling resulted in different metabolic enzymes utilized by T cells to facilitate similar biochemical endpoints. Furthermore, this study shows that cyclosporine represses the pathways involved in amino acid and glucose metabolism, providing novel insights on the immunosuppressive mechanisms of this drug. To explore the implications of the findings of this study in clinical settings, conventional immunosuppressants were tested in combination with drugs that target metabolic pathways. Results showed that such combinations increased efficacy of conventional immunosuppressants.

We present a proteome-wide atlas of age-associated alterations in human haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPCs) along with five other cell types that constitute the bone marrow niche. For each, the abundance of a large fraction of the ~12,000 proteins identified was assessed in a cohort of healthy human subjects from different age. As the HPCs became older, pathways in central carbon metabolism exhibited features reminiscent of the Warburg effect where glycolytic intermediates are rerouted towards anabolism. Simultaneously, altered abundance of early regulators of HPC differentiation revealed a reduced functionality and a bias towards myeloid differentiation at the expense of lymphoid development. Ageing caused significant alterations in the bone marrow niche too, such as functionality of the pathways involved in HPC homing and lineage differentiation. The data represents a valuable resource for further in-depth mechanistic analyses, and for validation of knowledge gained from animal models.

Overall design: Gene expression profiling was performed by 3'' End RNA Sequencing (3SEQ), a next generation sequencing approach that does not rely on frozen tissue but can be performed on archival FFPE tissue. Samples included 99 LMS, 6 Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcomas (UPS), 3 leiomyomas, 4 normal myometrium samples, and 1 case of Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). This study only includes the 99 LMS Samples. After gene expression levels were quantified by 3SEQ analysis pipeline, Consensus Clustering with bootstrap method was used to determine that the dataset contained three robust subtypes, and Silhouette analysis was performed to validate the subtype assignments. Two class SAM analysis (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) was performed to identify genes expressed differentially between each subtype of LMS with FDR of 0.05. Immunohistochemical staining was used to validate the potential diagnostic and prognostic markers from 3SEQ data on a tissue microarray."

Here, we describe a three-dimensional (3D) approach to cell culture in vitro, utilizing a bioreactor system designed to control oxygenation of 3D cancer cell cultures, in order to better mimic tumor microenvironments observed in vivo. We found transcriptomic differences in breast and ovarian cancer cell cultures grown in traditional monolayer cultures as compared to cultures grown in a Matrigel three-dimensional matrix. We also investigated the transcriptomes of 3D cultures grown in 21% O2, 3% O2, and a gradient of 3% O2 to 0% O2 using our bioreactor system. By controlling oxygen delivery, we observed differences in cell growth morphology and transcriptome regulation under the three conditions. Overall design: Examination of the effects of oxygenation gradients on 3D cancer cell cultures grown in a bioreactor. 3D cell cultures grown in 3% oxygen, 21% oxygen, and gradient oxygen are examined and compared to cells grown in 2D 21% oxygen.

Here, we screened a large cohort of subjects with increased risk for diabetes and identified two subjects with impaired glucose tolerance carrying heterozygous missense mutations in the PDX1 coding region leading to single amino acid exchanges (P33T, C18R) in its transactivation domain. We generated iPSCs from patients with heterozygous PDX1P33T/+, PDX1C18R/+ mutations and engineered isogenic cell lines carrying homozygous PDX1P33T/P33T, PDX1C18R/C18R mutations and a heterozygous PDX1 loss-of-function mutation (PDX1+/-). Using an in vitro ß-cell differentiation protocol, we demonstrated that both PDX1P33T/+, PDX1C18R/+ and PDX1P33T/P33T, PDX1C18R/C18R mutations impair ß-cell differentiation and function. Furthermore, PDX1+/- and PDX1P33T/P33T mutations reduced differentiation efficiency of pancreatic progenitors (PPs), due to downregulation of PDX1-bound genes, including transcription factors MNX1 and PDX1 as well as insulin resistance gene CES1. Additionally, both PDX1P33T/+ and PDX1P33T/P33T mutations in PPs reduced the expression of PDX1-bound genes including the long-noncoding RNA, MEG3 and the imprinted gene NEURONATIN, both involved in insulin synthesis and secretion. Our results reveal mechanistic details of how diabetes-associated PDX1 point mutations impair human pancreatic endocrine lineage formation and ß-cell function and contribute to pre-disposition for diabetes.

Although early immune events influence infection outcome, the cellular composition, molecular effectors, and timeframe of the host response active shortly after viral exposure remain incompletely understood. Employing specimens collected from people who inject drugs (PWID) with high risk of HCV exposure, we utilized RNA-Seq to characterize immune function in peripheral blood before, during, and after acute HCV infection resulting in spontaneous resolution. Our results provide a detailed description of innate immune programs active in peripheral blood during acute HCV infection, which include prominent type I interferon and inflammatory signatures. Innate immune gene expression rapidly returns to pre-infection levels upon viral clearance. This innate response coincides with a decrease in B cell transcriptional signatures. These results represent the first longitudinal transcriptomic characterization of human immune function in acute HCV infection and identify several dynamically regulated features of the complex response to natural HCV exposure. Overall design: mRNA-Seq of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from individuals before, during, and after acute HCV infection. Acute HCV infection resulted in spotaneous viral resolution (n=6) or chronic infection (n=8).

Yet the relationship with long-term clinical outcomes remains unclear. Objective: We evaluated transcriptome alterations in AT during LCD and association with weight and glycemic outcomes both at LCD termination and 6-month after the LCD. Results: Upon LCD, we identified 1'173 genes differentially expressed; with 350 and 33 genes associated respectively with changes in BMI and Matsuda. Twenty-nine genes were associated with both endpoints. Pathway analyses highlighted enrichment in lipid and glucose metabolism. Models were constructed to predict weight maintainers. A model based on clinical baseline parameters could not achieve any prediction (validation's AUC= 0.50 [0.36, 0.64]), while a model based on clinical changes during LCD yielded to good performance (AUC=0.73 [0.60, 0.87]). Incorporating baseline expression from the 18 genes outperformed the best clinical model (AUC=0.87 [0.77, 0.96], Delong's p=0.012). Similar analyses were made to predict subjects with good glycemic improvements. Both baseline- and LCD-based clinical models yielded to similar performance (with best AUC=0.73 [0.60, 0.85]). Addition of expression changes during LCD improved substantially the performance (AUC=0.80 [0.69, 0.92], p=0.058). Conclusions: This study investigated AT transcriptome alterations following LCD in a large cohort of obese, non-diabetic patients. The identified genes enabled to significantly improve clinical models and predict long-term clinical outcomes. These biomarkers may help clinicians understanding the large inter-subject variability and better predict the success of dietary interventions. Overall design: Design: Using RNAseq, we analyzed transcriptome changes in AT from 191 obese, non-diabetic patients within a multi-center controlled dietary intervention. Expression changes were associated with outcomes after 8-week LCD (with 800-1000kcal/d) and 6-month after LCD. Results were validated using RT-qPCR in 350 subjects from the same cohort. Statistical models were constructed to predict subjects considered as weight maintainers or glycemic improvers 6-month after LCD."

Although the essential role of GATA2 for the onset of mouse hematopoiesis is well established, its involvement during early human hematopoietic development is not clear. By combining time-controlled overexpression of GATA2 with genetic knockout experiments, we found that GATA2, at the mesoderm specification stage, promotes the generation of hemogenic progenitors and their further differentiation to hematopoietic progenitor cells, while negatively regulating cardiac differentiation. Surprisingly, genome-wide transcriptional and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that GATA2 bound preferentially to regulatory regions, and repressed the expression of cardiac development-related genes. By contrast, genes important for hematopoietic differentiation were upregulated by GATA2 in a mostly indirect manner. Collectively, our data reveal a hitherto unrecognized role of GATA2 as a direct repressor of cardiac fates, and highlight the importance of coordinating the specification and repression of alternative cell fates. Overall design: Single cells RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis of mesodermal and hemogenic progenitors derived from human iPS with and without GATA2 gene overexpression."

However, the developmental landscape and underlying molecular signals during human spermatogenesis remain unknown. Here, we examined human spermatogenesis using transcriptome-wide single-cell RNA sequencing of 2,854 individual testicular cells from donors with normal spermatogenesis (donors with normal fertility or OA) and 174 testicular cells from one donor diagnosed as having nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). Systematic bioinformatics analyses enabled us to delineate the full developmental trajectories of human spermatogenesis. A hierarchical model was established, which was characterized by the sequential and step-wise development of three spermatogonia subtypes, seven spermatocyte subtypes, and four spermatid subtypes. Furthermore, we recapitulated key hallmarks of human spermatogenesis at the single-cell level, including spermatogonial development, mitosis-to-meiosis transition, meiotic recombination, meiotic sex chromosome inactivation, and histone-to-protamine exchange. Remarkably, BMPR1B and FGFR3 were identified as novel markers of human spermatogonial stem cells, indicating the potentially critical role of BMP and FGF signaling pathways for SSC maintenance. Further analysis identified several novel marker genes of specific cell type such as HMGA1, PIWIL4, TEX29, SCML1, and CCDC112, the expression patterns of which were confirmed via RNA FISH or immunostaining. We also demonstrated that scRNA-seq provided a platform to find differentially expressed genes correlated with one type of nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) at the genome-wide transcriptional profiling level, which might pave way for further diagnosis and dissecting the underlying mechanisms of male infertility. Our work allows for the reconstruction of transcriptional programs inherent to sequential cell fate transition during human spermatogenesis and has implications for deciphering male-related reproductive disorders. Overall design: Here we performed scRNA sequencing for 2,854 individual human testicular cells including spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, and testicular somatic cells (soma) from donors with normal fertility and obstructive azoospermia.Besides, another 174 human testicular cells from one NOA male were included as an example of infertilty.

In developing a large case/control schizophrenia (SZ) hiPSC-derived cohort of neural progenitor cells and neurons, we identified and accounted for a variety of technical and biological sources of variation. Reducing the stochastic effects of the differentiation process by correcting for cell type composition boosted the SZ signal in hiPSC-based models and increased the concordance with post mortem datasets. Because this concordance was strongest in hiPSC-neurons, it suggests that this cell type may better model genetic risk for SZ. We predict a growing convergence between hiPSC and post mortem studies as both approaches expand to larger cohort sizes. For studies of complex genetic disorders, to maximize the power of hiPSC cohorts currently feasible, in most cases and whenever possible, we recommend expanding the number of individuals even at the expense of the number of replicate hiPSC clones.

The relevance of these findings to humans and the mechanisms mediating JunB function are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that impaired JunB function via gene silencing or overexpression of a dominant negative mutant increased human keratinocyte cell proliferation but decreased cell barrier function. RNA-seq revealed over 500 genes affected by JunB loss-of-function which included an upregulation of an array of proinflammatory molecules relevant to psoriasis. Among these were TNFa, CCL2, CXCL10, IL6R and SQSTM1, an adaptor protein involved in NF-kB activation. ChIP-Seq and gene reporter analyses showed that JunB directly suppressed SQSTM1 through binding to a consensus AP-1 cis-element located around 2 Kb upstream of SQSTM1-trasncription start site. Similar to JunB loss-of-function, SQSTM1-overexpression induced TNFa, CCL2 and CXCL10. Conversely, NF-kB-inhibition genetically with a mutant IkBa or pharmacologically with PDTC prevented cytokine, but not IL6R, induction by JunB-deficiency.  Taken together, our findings indicate that JunB controls epidermal growth, barrier formation and proinflammatory responses through direct and indirect mechanisms, pinpointing SQSTM1 as a key mediator of JunB-suppression of NF-kB-dependent inflammation. Overall design: 3 indepdent set of priamry human keratinocytes isolated from foreskin skin samples were transfected with nonsilencing control or siRNA oligonucleotides targeting JunB. mRNA was then isolated and used for cDNA library construction followed by RNA-sequencing."

In order to gain better insight into regulatory processes that underlie variation in complex phenotypes, we must have access to faithful model systems for a wide range of tissues and cell types. To facilitate this, we have generated a panel of 7 fully characterized chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines derived from fibroblasts of healthy donors. All lines are free of integration from exogenous reprogramming vectors, can be maintained using standard iPSC culture techniques, and have proliferative and differentiation potential similar to human and mouse lines. To begin demonstrating the utility of comparative iPSC panels, we collected RNA-seq data and methylation profiles from the chimpanzee iPSCs and their corresponding fibroblast precursors, as well as from 7 human iPSCs and their precursors, which were of multiple cell type and population origins. Overall, we observed much less regulatory variation within species in the iPSCs than in the somatic precursors, indicating that the reprogramming process has erased many of the differences observed between somatic cells of different origins. We identified 4,918 differentially expressed genes and 1,986 differentially methylated regions between iPSCs of the two species, many of which are novel inter-species differences and not observed between the somatic cells of the two species.

Transcriptome-wide expression study using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of whole blood was conducted in 324 World Trade Center responders (201 with never, 81 current and 42 past PTSD). The current and never PTSD samples were randomly split to form both discovery (N=195) and replication (N=87) cohorts. Differentially expressed genes identified in RNA-Seq were used in pathway analysis and to create a polygenic expression score. There were 448 differentially expressed genes in the discovery cohort, of which 99 remained significant in the replication cohort, and 5 (FKBP5, NDUFA1, CCDC85B, SNORD54, SNORD46) showed >1.2-fold difference in expression consistently between the discovery and replication cohorts. Several enriched biological pathways were found, including glucocorticoid receptor signaling and immunity-related pathways, but were not significant following FDR correction. The gene expression score achieved sensitivity of 0.917 and specificity of 0.508 for identifying PTSD cases in the replication cohort. It was similar in current and past PTSD, with both groups scoring higher than trauma-exposed controls. We confirmed the role of FKBP5 in PTSD and identified four additional differentially expressed genes that may constitute biomarkers for this condition. Together with the pathway analysis results, these findings point to HPA-axis and immune dysregulation as key biological processes underpinning PTSD. A novel polygenic expression aggregate that differentiates PTSD patients from trauma-exposed controls might be a useful screening tool for research and clinical practice, if replicated in other populations.

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP105199",51,"Chromosomal instability promotes metastasis through a cytosolic DNA response","Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer, and it results from ongoing errors in chromosome segregation during mitosis. While CIN is a major driver of tumor evolution, its role in metastasis has not been established. Here we show that CIN promotes metastasis by sustaining a tumor-cell autonomous inflammatory response to cytosolic DNA. Errors in chromosome segregation create a preponderance of micronuclei whose envelopes frequently rupture exposing their DNA content to the cytosol. This leads to the activation of the cGAS-STING cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway and downstream noncanonical NF-kB signaling.  Genetic suppression of CIN significantly delays metastasis in transplantable tumor models, whereas inducing chromosome segregation errors promotes cellular invasion and metastasis in a STING-dependent manner. In contrast to primary tumors, human and mouse metastases strongly select for CIN, in part, due to its ability to enrich for metastasis-initiating mesenchymal subpopulations, offering an opportunity to target chromosome segregation errors for therapeutic benefit. Overall design: To determine whether CIN is causally involved in metastasis, we devised a genetic approach to alter the rate of chromosome missegregation in transplantable tumor models of human TNBC (MDA-MB-231); cont: Control sample.

While mTORC1 activation is involved in its growth, mTORC1 inhibitors fail to eradicate AML, highlighting the need for new therapies. Moreover, the identity of the AML cell of origin is obscure. AML research, however, is hampered by the lack of in-vivo models. Here, we establish a human AML-xenograft (Xn) model in mice, recapitulating AML at the histological and molecular levels. Microarray analysis demonstrated tumor growth in-vivo to involve robust PPARG-pathway activation. Similarly, immunostaining revealed strong PPARG expression in human AML specimens. Accordingly, we demonstrate that while PPARG agonism accelerates AML growth, PPARG antagonism is inhibitory, strongly suppressing AML proliferation and tumor-initiating capacity, via an anti-TGFb mechanism. Finally, we show striking similarity between AML cell lines and multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in terms of antigen and gene expression and differentiation potential. Altogether, we establishment the first in-vivo human AML model, provide evidence that AML may originate in a PPARG-activated renal MSC lineage that is skewed towards adipocytes and smooth muscle and away from osteoblasts, and uncover PPARG as a regulator of AML growth, which could serve as an attractive therapeutic target.

The expression of 338 genes differed between subjects with SIRS and those with sepsis, primarily reflective of immune activation in sepsis. The expression of 1,238 genes differed with sepsis outcome: Nonsurvivors had lower expression of many immune function-related genes. Functional genetic variants associated with sepsis mortality were sought based on a common disease – rare variant hypothesis. VPS9D1, whose expression was increased in sepsis survivors, had a higher burden of missense variants in sepsis survivors, and these were associated with altered expression of 3,799 genes, primarily reflecting Golgi and endosome biology. Conclusions: Host response in sepsis survivors – activation of immune response-related genes – was muted in sepsis nonsurvivors. The association of sepsis survival with robust immune response and presence of missense variants in VPS9D1 warrants replication and further functional studies. Overall design: We sequenced peripheral blood RNA of 129 representative subjects with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS, n=23) or sepsis (infection with SIRS), including 78 sepsis survivors and 28 sepsis nonsurvivors, who had previously undergone plasma proteomic and metabolomic profiling."

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP104300",68,"Intrinsic Immunity Shapes Viral Resistance of Stem Cells","Numerous studies have demonstrated that stem cells are more resistant to virus infection than their differentiated progenies; however, the nature of this differential virus resistance remains a mystery. Here we analyzed gene expression in both mammalian stem cells and cells at various stages of differentiation. We found that stem cells intrinsically express a subset of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and that this property is conserved across species. We show that ISG expression is truly intrinsic, as stem cells are refractory to interferon (IFN). Further, ISG expression varies in a cell type-specific manner and decreases as cells differentiate. We show that once cell differentiate they become IFN-responsive and a broad spectrum of ISGs are then induced by canonical IFN signaling. Importantly, we also show that intrinsically expressed ISGs protect stem cells from virus infection. Finally, we performed in vivo experiments to show that protecting stem cells from virus infection is critical because stem cells are needed to regenerate tissues damaged by virus infection. Our findings have important implications for understanding both stem cell biology and the evolution of innate immunity. Overall design: mRNA profiles for hESC-derived cells and primary cells were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate or triplicate, using IlluminaHiSeq 2000."

IL-21 and IL-15 are implicated in the pathogenesis of type-1 diabetes, graft-versus-host disease, and celiac disease (CeD), a gluten-mediated autoimmune-like enteropathy. Attempts to treat type-1 diabetes and graft-versus-host disease with biologics targeting one particular cytokine have failed. Both IL-15 and IL-21 have been suggested to drive activation of cytotoxic T cells (CTL) that are the effectors mediating tissue destruction in CeD and organ-specific autoimmune disorders. We show that the concomitant upregulation of IL-15 and IL-21 occurs only in full-blown CeD with villous atrophy. BNZ-2, a peptide that targets the ?c, was able to block the cooperative IL-15/IL-21 mediated transcriptional activation of human tissue-resident intraepithelial CTL. Importantly, this inhibition was specific and did not interfere with IL-2 signaling, a cytokine with known immunoregulatory functions. Moreover, BNZ-2 blocked gluten-induced IFN-? production in small intestinal organ cultures from CeD patients. These observations identify BNZ-2 as a therapeutic candidate for immune disorders in which IL-15 and IL-21 cooperate to induce CTL-mediated tissue damage. Overall design: Gene expression profiles of human tissue-resident IE-CTLs (both in vitro and ex vivo), before and after simulation with IL-15 and IL-21 (individually and in combination)."

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP087577",56,"Adaptation of a RAS pathway activation signature from FF to FFPE tissues in colorectal cancer (FFPE RNA-Seq II)","Background: The KRAS gene is mutated in about 40% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases, which has been clinically validated as a predictive mutational marker of intrinsic resistatnce to anti-EGFR inhibitor (EGFRi) therapy. Since nearly 60% of patients with a wild type KRAS fail to respond to EGFRi treatment, there is a need to develop more reliable molecular signatures to better predict response. Here we address the challenge of adapting a gene expression signature predictive of RAS pathway activation, created using fresh frozen (FF) tissues, for use with more widely available formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Methods: In this study, we evaluated the translation of an 18-gene RAS pathway signature score from FF to FFPE in 54 CRC cases, using a head-to-head comparison of five technology platforms. FFPE-based technologies included the Affymetrix GeneChip (Affy), NanoString nCounter(NanoS), Illumina whole genome RNASeq (RNA-Acc), Illumina targeted RNASeq(t-RNA), and Illumina stranded Total RNA-rRNA-depletion (rRNA). Results: Using Affy_FF as the ""gold"" standard, initial analysis of the 18-gene RAS scores on all 54 samples shows varying pairwise Spearman correlations, with (1) Affy_FFPE(r=0.233, p=0.090); (2) NanoS_FFPE(r=0.608, p<0.0001); (3) RNA-Acc_FFPE(r=0.175, p=0.21); (4) t-RNA_FFPE (r=-0.237, p=0.085); and (5) t-RNA (r=-0.012, p=0.93). These results suggest that only NanoString has successful FF to FFPE translation. The subsequent removal of identified ""problematic"" samples (n=15) and gene (n=2) further improves the correlations of Affy_FF with three of the five technologies: Affy_FFPE (r=0.672, p<0.0001); NanoS_FFPE (r=0.738, p<0.0001); and RNA-Acc_FFPE (r=0.483, p=0.002). Conclusions: Of the five technology platforms tested, NanoString technology provides a more faithful translation of the RAS pathway gene expression signature from FF to FFPE than the Affymetrix GeneChip and multiple RNASeq technologies. Moreover, NanoString was the most forgiving technology in the analysis of samples with presumably poor RNA quality. Using this approach, the RAS signature score may now be reasonably applied to FFPE clinical samples. Overall design: Fifty-four (54) FFPE evaluable tumor specimens were selected from a larger multi-center cohort of 468 well-characterized colorectal adenocarcinoma patients whose tissues were obtained between October 2006 and September 2010 at the University of South Florida. The sample cohort was composed of tumor samples that were available as matched fresh-frozen (FF) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) pairs."

Next, strand-specific rRNA depleted RNA-seq library was constructed using VAHTS Total RNA-seq (H/M/R) Library Prep Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). Briefly, rRNAs were removed and the retained RNAs were fragmented into short fragments by using fragmentation buffer and reverse transcribed into cDNA with random primers. Second-strand cDNA were synthesized by DNA polymerase I, RNase H, dNTP (dUTP instead of dTTP) and buffer. Next, the cDNA fragments were purified with VAHTSTM DNA Clean Beads, end repaired, poly(A) added, and ligated to Illumina sequencing adapters. Then UNG (Uracil-N-Glycosylase) was used to digest the second-strand cDNA. The digested products were purified with VAHTSTM DNA Clean Beads, PCR amplified to complete library construction. To enhance sensitivity of low abundance CircRNA detection, linear RNAs depleted RNA-seq library were also constructed for each sample. total RNAs were treated with RNase R to degrade the linear RNAs, and purified using RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen,Venlo,The Netherlands).

We selected a cohort of 25 high-risk prostate tumors, representing the lethal phenotype, and applied deep RNA-sequencing and matched whole genome sequencing, followed by detailed molecular characterization.   Results: Ten tumors were exposed to neo-adjuvant hormone therapy and expressed marked evidence of therapy response in all except one extreme case, which demonstrated early resistance via apparent neuroendocrine transdifferentiation. We observe high inter-tumor heterogeneity, including unique sets of outlier transcripts in each tumor. Interestingly, outlier expression converged on druggable cellular pathways associated with cell cycle progression, translational control or immune regulation, suggesting distinct contemporary pathway affinity and a mechanism of tumor stratification. We characterize hundreds of novel fusion transcripts, including a high frequency of ETS fusions associated with complex genome rearrangements and the disruption of tumor suppressors. Remarkably, several tumors express unique but potentially-oncogenic non-ETS fusions, which may contribute to the phenotype of individual tumors, and have significance for disease progression. Finally, one ETS-negative tumor has a striking tandem duplication genotype which appears to be highly aggressive and present at low recurrence in ETS-negative prostate cancer, suggestive of a novel molecular subtype.   Conclusions: The multitude of rare genomic and transcriptomic events detected in a high-risk tumors cohort offer novel opportunities for personalized oncology and their convergence on key pathways and functions has broad implications for precision medicine."

The second goal was to determine how these differentially expressed genes are changed when the same cells are transformed into tumorigenic cells (EMP-iPrECs) through overexpression of Erg, Myc, and shRNA to Pten (Cancer Res 74:3357-68, 2014).  In the iPrECs, we readily identified many genes that were up and down regulated over time during differentiation.  Genes that decreased include many cell cycle genes, and genes that increased include known differentiation markers.  The EMP cells did not differentiate as previously reported and was supported by the general lack of any major changes in gene expression over the EMP time course.  When iPrECs were compared to EMPs, there were over 2000 differentially expressed genes that did not overlap with the differentially expressed genes identified during the normal differentiation time course.  Thus, oncogenic transformation of PrECs results in major gene expression changes and abrogates the differentiation program. Overall design: Approach was to collect and isolate polyA-selected RNA from from two cell lines; normal human immortalized PrECs (iPrECs) and transformed human EMP-iPrECs, which had been subjected to an in vitro differentiation assay (J Cell Sci 123:266-76, 2010).  EMP-iPrECs were generated by stable expression of Erg, Myc and shRNA to Pten iPrECs (Cancer Res 74:3357-68, 2014).  Specifically, total RNA was isolated from the cells at specified time points during the course of iPrEC or EMP-iPrEC differentiation. Differentiation in untransformed cells results in a bilayer of epithelial cells- basal and luminal cells. The RNA isolated from the last two time points for iPrECs include only the luminal cells which were dissociated from the basal cells. The EMP-iPrECs did not form a bilayer, therefore all time points contain the whole population. Each time point for each cell line includes biological triplicates.

Objective: Derive and validate a blood transcriptomic predictor of forced vital capacity (FVC) decline. Methods: A training cohort (n=74) of IPF patients was stratified according to the presence of progressive disease, defined as =10% relative decline in FVC over 12 months. Baseline to 4-month within-patient changes in gene expression were correlated with categorical FVC decline. Genes predictive of FVC decline were identified by two-group comparison with false discovery rate <5% followed by logistic LASSO regression and 10-Fold Cross-Validation for gene list prioritization. Independent validation cohorts with differing transcriptome assay platforms and blood transcriptome sampling times from UChicago (n=27), UPMC (n=35), and Imperial (n=24) underwent receiver operating characteristic with area under the curve (AUC) analyses for validation. Results: A longitudinally-derived FVC-gene predictor accurately discriminated most patients with stable and progressive IPF across four independent IPF cohorts with variable transcriptomic assay platforms and sampling times. The FVC-gene predictorand demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 74.3% and 82.4% in the combined replication cohort. The likelihood ratio, LR+ and LR- were 4.11 and 0.32, respectively. TGF-beta was the highest-ranking canonical pathway by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. An approach using longitudinal gene expression changes approach dramatically reduced within-group variation compared to cross-sectional expression for improved prediction modeling. Conclusions: This novel FVC-gene predictor developed from short-term longitudinal gene expression changes successfully discriminates most patients with high likelihood of one-year 10% FVC decline. This tool may better reflect disease activity and prove useful for predictive enrichment of clinical trial populations. Overall design: Study populations were collected from the University of Chicago Medical Center and was approved by the institutional review board (IRB#14163) and informed consent was provided by all study subjects. All patients with IPF met American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) diagnosis criteria. Demographic information, clinical characteristics, and pulmonary function tests were collected from all patients with IPF. Spirometry testing, including forced vital capacity percent predicted (FVC% predicted), diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide percent predicted (DLCO % predicted) as well as lung volumes by plethysmography were obtained per ATS guidelines. The prognosis of IPF subjects was dichotomously categorized as FVC stable (FVC-S) or FVC decline (FVC-D) defined by < or =10% reduction in FVC% predicted from the baseline to over 2 years of follow-up.

Here we show an additional epidermal MNP subset that can be distinguished from LCs phenotypically as CD11chi, CD1c+ MR+ (epidermal CD11c+ DCs). These cells are transcriptionally similar to dermal cDC2 but express higher levels of costimulatory markers and are more efficient at T cell stimulation. Importantly, compared to LC, epidermal CD11c+ DCs are i) enriched in the epithelium of anogenital tissues where they preferentially interact with HIV, ii) express the higher levels of the HIV entry receptor CCR5, iii)  support the higher levels of HIV uptake and replication and iv) are more efficient at transferring virus to CD4 T cells. Importantly these findings were observed using both a lab-adapted and transmitted/founder strain of HIV. We also describe a cell population that can be discerned from LCs by their lower surface expression of CD45, HLA-DR and CD33 (epidermal CD33low cells). These are transcriptionally similar to LCs but do not appear to function as APCs as do not secrete cytokines, express negligible amounts of costimulatory molecules and are very weak inducers of T cell proliferation. They also do not act as HIV target cells. Our findings reveal a new subset of epidermal DCs in skin and anogenital tissues with a potential key role in sexual transmission of HIV.

The mechanism of action is pleiotropic but impacts directly on CTCL cell proliferation, chemotaxis and apoptosis, and indirectly on lymphoma immunity. Bexarotene causes hypothyroidism in more than 90% of patients thus requiring the concomitant administration of levothyroxine. Hereon we investigated the consequence of levothyroxine administration to the antineoplastic effect of bexarotene in CTCL. We found that bexarotene induces transcriptional and biological changes in CTCL cells related to decreased cell proliferation and chemotaxis, as well as increased proliferation and interferon response. Although lack of levothyroxine supplementation during bexarotene treatment increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation of CTCL cells in vitro and in vivo, it also decreased the lymphoma immunity. Since levothyroxine activates both the ubiquitous TRA nuclear receptor and the more restricted integrin ?V?3 membrane receptor that is overexpressed in CTCL cells, we investigated their role in bexarotene treatment. We demonstrated that genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of the integrin ?V?3 receptors resulted in improved bexarotene-induced effects on apoptosis, cell proliferation and chemotaxis while maintaining the lymphoma immunity. Our results provide a mechanistic rationale for evaluating the addition of the integrin ?V?3 inhibitor cilengitide to CTCL therapeutic regimens that are based on bexarotene and levothyroxine supplementation.

Yet, a growing body of evidence indicates that DNA methylation levels can change rapidly, for example, in innate immune cells facing an infectious agent. Nevertheless, the causal relationship between changes in DNA methylation and gene expression during infection remains to be elucidated. Here, we generated time-course data on DNA methylation, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility patterns during infection of human dendritic cells with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We found that the immune response to infection is accompanied by active demethylation of thousands of CpG sites overlapping distal enhancer elements. However, virtually all changes in gene expression in response to infection occur prior to detectable changes in DNA methylation, indicating that the observed losses in methylation are a downstream consequence of transcriptional activation. Footprinting analysis revealed that immune-related transcription factors (TF), such as NF-?B/Rel, are recruited to enhancer elements prior to the observed losses in methylation, suggesting that DNA demethylation is mediated by TF binding to cis-acting elements. Collectively, our results show that DNA demethylation is not necessarily required for the establishment of the core regulatory program engaged upon infection.

AECs in monolayer culture and differentiated epithelial cells in air-liquid interface (ALI) represent two distinct and commonly used in vitro models, yet differences in their response to pathogens have not been investigated. In this study, we compared the transcriptional effects of flagellin on AECs in monolayer culture versus ALI culture using exon microarrays and RNAsequencing. We found that AECs cultured in monolayer and ALI have strikingly different transcriptional states at baseline. When challenged with flagellin, monolayer AEC cultures greatly increased transcription of numerous genes mapping to wounding response, immunity and inflammatory response. In contrast, AECs in ALI culture had an unexpectedly muted response to flagellin, both in number of genes expressed and relative enrichment of inflammatory and immune pathways. In conclusion, In vitro culturing methods have a dramatic effect on the transcriptional profile of AECs at baseline and after stimulation with flagellin. These differences suggest that epithelial responses to pathogen challenges are distinctly different in culture models of intact and injured epithelium. Overall design: A total of eight independent RNAseq experiments were conducted.

YY1 acts both as a repressor and an activator of gene expression. We have identified 23 individuals with de novo mutations or deletions of YY1 and phenotypic features that define a syndrome of cognitive impairment, behavioral alterations, intrauterine growth retardation, feeding problems, and various congenital malformations. Our combined clinical and molecular data define the 'YY1 syndrome' as a haploinsufficiency syndrome. Through immunoprecipitation of YY1-bound chromatin from person-derived cells, using antibodies recognizing both ends of the protein, we show that YY1 deletions and missense mutations lead to a global loss of YY1 binding, with a preferential retention at high-occupancy sites. Finally, we uncover a widespread loss of H3K27 acetylation in particular on the YY1-bound enhancers, underscoring a crucial role for YY1 in enhancer regulation. Collectively, these results define a clinical syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of YY1 through dysregulation of key transcriptional regulators. Overall design: Individuals with mutations or deletion in YY1 were identified among patients with idiopathic intellectual disability.

Gene expression profiling has emerged as a promising tool for understanding the pathophysiology of PTSD. However, to date, all but one gene expression study was based on whole blood or unsorted peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), a complex tissue consisting of several populations of cells. The objective of this study was to utilize RNA sequencing to simultaneously profile the gene-expression of four immune cell subpopulations in World Trade Center responders. Pathway analyses identified gene sets related to immune response and inflammation as being among the differentially expressed genes in PTSD, including mast cell activation and regulation in CD4T, interferon-beta production in CD8T, and neutrophil related gene sets in monocytes. These findings are suggestive that immune cell dysregulation involves gene expression in various cell populations."
"human","data_sources/sra","SRP132693",91,"A Comparative Assessment of iPSC Derived Cardiomyocytes with Heart Tissues in Humans and Chimpanzees","To study regulatory differences between species, the field of comparative primate genomics has used several approaches, including the use of post mortem frozen tissues, cell lines, and model organisms. However, there are limited quality cell lines from primates and post-mortem tissues cannot be staged, are not amenable to experimental perturbations and are often subject to high environmental variances. Inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are an attractive system to study primate biology in a comparative context. However, the fidelity of iPSC derived cell types to primary tissues needs to be assayed in a comparative primate context before the utility of iPSCs can be fully realized for comparative genomics. In order to comprehensively benchmark the performance of iPSC model systems in a comparative framework, we collected RNA-sequencing from primary adult heart tissue and iPSC derived cardiomyocytes from multiple human and chimpanzee individuals.  We identified the optimal parameters of iPSC differentiation into cardiomyocytes that minimized differences between each species and their respective adult tissue counterparts in a balanced manner across species. We found that iPSC derived cardiomyocytes are able to recapitulate 50% of the interspecies gene expression differences identified between human and chimpanzee in primary post mortem heart tissues. Furthermore, we determined that cultured cardiomyocytes appear more similar to adult hearts than any other single tissue in their ability to recapitulate differences in gene regulation between human and chimpanzee. Overall design: We differentiated multiple human (9) and chimpanzee (10) iPSC lines into cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) for 15 days using a recently developed protocol (Burridge et al. 2014; Burridge et al. 2015). After replating at day 15, iPSC-CMs were cultured for 12 more days, resulting in a total differentiation time of 27 days. On days 20-27, iPSC-CMs were treated with T3 (methods), a subset of 5 human and 6 chimpanzee iPSC-CMs were cultured in parallel without T3 treatment. We harvested RNA from all source iPSC lines, iPSC-CMs (day 15), T3 treated and untreated iPSC-CMs (day 27) sample. We harvested RNA from an additional set of 5 human and 6 chimp T3 treated day 27 samples in a second batch that did not have a matched day 15 and (-) T3 set.  Finally, we collected RNA from flash frozen primary heart tissues (21 chimps and 11 humans)."

The causative pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), is estimated to have infected up to a third of the world's population; however, only approximately 10% of healthy individuals progress to active TB disease. Despite evidence for heritability, it is not currently possible to predict whether a healthy person is susceptible to TB. To explore approaches to classify susceptibility to TB, we infected with MTB dendritic cells (DCs) from putatively resistant individuals diagnosed with latent TB, and from susceptible individuals that had recovered from a past episode of active TB. We measured genome-wide gene expression levels in infected and non-infected cells and found hundreds of differentially expressed genes between susceptible and resistant individuals in the non-infected cells. We further found that genetic polymorphisms in proximity to the differentially expressed genes between susceptible and resistant individuals are more likely to be associated with TB susceptibility in published GWAS data. By intersecting the gene expression and GWAS data, we identified two promising candidate genes: CCL1 and UNC13A. Lastly, we trained a classifier based on the gene expression levels in the non-infected cells, and demonstrated decent performance on our data and an independent data set. Overall, our promising results from this small study suggest that training a classifier on a larger cohort may enable us to accurately predict TB susceptibility. Overall design: We obtained whole blood samples from 25 healthy male Caucasian individuals. Six of the donors had recovered from active TB, and are thus putatively susceptible. The remaining 19 tested positive for latent TB without ever experiencing symptoms of active TB, and are thus putatively resistant. We isolated dendritic cells (DCs) and treated them with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) or a mock control for 18 hours. To measure genome-wide gene expression levels in infected and non-infected samples, we isolated and sequenced RNA using a processing pipeline designed to minimize the introduction of unwanted technical variation. There are a total of 50 samples (25 individuals x 2 treatments)."

SF3B1, the most frequently mutated component of the spliceosome in cancer, is involved in the recognition of the branch point sequence (BPS) during selection of the 3' splice site (ss) in RNA splicing. Here, we report that common and tumor-specific splicing aberrations are induced by SF3B1 mutations and establish aberrant 3' ss selection as the most frequent splicing defect. Strikingly, mutant SF3B1 utilizes a BPS that differs from that used by wild-type SF3B1 and requires the canonical 3' ss to enable aberrant splicing during the second step. Approximately 50% of the aberrantly spliced mRNAs are subjected to nonsense-mediated decay resulting in downregulation of gene and protein expression. These findings ascribe functional significance to the consequences of SF3B1 mutations in cancer.

Additionally, they are involved in the regulation of cellular stress responses and ECM degradation. To get insights into KDELR1 specific functions, we characterized a KDELR1-KO cell line (HAP1) and performed a whole transcriptome analysis comparing KDELR1-KO and the respective wildtype HAP1 cells. Our data indicates more than 300 significantly differentially expressed genes which are mainly associated with developmental processes, cell adhesion and ECM composition point to severe cellular disorders due to KDELR1 loss. Impaired adhesion capacity of KDELR1-KO cells was further confirmed by adhesion assays and might be caused by deficient ECM formation due to transport defects. Thus, ECM rescue by collagen- and laminin-coating nearly doubled the adhesion property of KDELR1-KO cells compared to wildtype, confirming transcriptional adaptation to improve the adhesion ability. Perturbations within the secretory pathway were further verified by an increased secretion of ER-resident PDI and decreased cell viability under ER stress conditions, suggesting strong difficulties for KDELR1-KO cells to maintain cellular homeostasis."

Through a uniquely large and informative cohort of transgene-free patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), along with their differentiated derivatives, we find that 7q11.23 CNV disrupt transcriptional circuits in disease-relevant pathways already at the pluripotent state. These alterations are then selectively amplified upon differentiation into disease-relevant lineages, thereby establishing the value of large iPSC cohorts in the elucidation of disease-relevant developmental pathways. In addition, we functionally define the quota of transcriptional dysregulation specifically caused by dosage imbalances in GTF2I (also known as TFII-I), a transcription factor in 7q11.23 thought to play a critical role in the two conditions, which we found associated to key repressive chromatin modifiers. Finally, we created an open-access web-based platform (accessible at http://bio.ieo.eu/wbs/ ) to make accessible our multi-layered datasets and integrate contributions by the entire community working on the molecular dissection of the 7q11.23 syndromes.

Instead, naturally occurring somatic mutations have been utilized to infer clonality and lineal relationships between cells in human tissues, but current approaches are limited by high error rates and scale, and provide little information about the state or function of the cells. Here, we show how somatic mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can be tracked by current single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) or single cell ATAC-Seq (scATAC-Seq) for simultaneous analysis of single cell lineage and state.

In response to exogenous Wnt3 effectors, Activin/SMADs switch to cooperate with ß-catenin and induce mesendodermal differentiation genes. We show here that the HIPPO effector YAP binds to the WNT3 gene enhancer and prevents the gene from being induced by Activin in proliferating hESCs. In the absence of YAP, Activin signaling is sufficient to induce expression of the endogenous Wnt3 cytokine, which stabilizes ß-catenin and selectively activates genes required for cardiac mesoderm (ME) formation. Interestingly, Activin-stimulated YAP-knockout hESCs strongly express ß-catenin-dependent cardiac mesoderm markers (BAF60c and HAND1), but unlike WT hESCs, fail to express cardiac inhibitor genes (CDX2, MSX1).  Accordingly, YAP-/- cells treated with Activin alone can differentiate efficiently to beating cardiomyocytes in culture, bypassing the need for sequential treatment with exogenous Wnt ligand and Wnt inhibitors.  Similarly, Activin in combination with small-molecule YAP inhibitors generates beating cardiomyocytes from wild-type hESCs following a one- step protocol. Our findings highlight an unanticipated role of YAP as an upstream regulator of WNT3 to maintain hESC pluripotency in the presence of Activin, and uncover a direct route for the development of human embryonic cardiac mesoderm. Overall design: We performed a set of sequencing experiments to identify the role of YAP in hESCs and whether YAP influences the activity of the Activin and Wnt signaling pathways during the mesoderm differentiation. We performed transcriptional profile of WT and YAP-KO cells under different Wnt or Activin treatments and performed ChIP-seq analysis of the Wnt and Activin effectors beta-catenin and Smad2,3. In parallel we also mapped the binding of the YAP protein together with TEAD4 DNA-binding protein in hESCs.

TET2 is frequently mutated or dysregulated in multiple human cancers, and loss of TET2 is associated with changes in DNA methylation patterns. Here, using newly developed TET2-specific antibodies and the estrogen response as a model system for studying the regulation of gene expression, we demonstrate that endogenous TET2 occupies active enhancers and facilitates the proper recruitment of ERalpha. Knockout of TET2 by CRISPR-CAS9 leads to a global increase of DNA-methylation at enhancers resulting in attenuation of the estrogen response. We further identified a positive feedback loop between TET2 and ERalpha, which further requires MLL3/COMPASS at these enhancers. Together, this study reveals an epigenetic axis coordinating a transcriptional program through enhancer activation via DNA demethylation. Overall design: To examine changes in histone modifications, ER-alpha occupancy, MLL3 occupancy, and gene expression changes after depletion of TET2 in human breast cancer cell lines."

We determined that activation of the Eif2ak2-Eif2a axis is the key mediator of translation initiation block in late phase sepsis. Reversal of this axis mitigated kidney injury. Furthermore, temporal profiling of the kidney translatome revealed that multiple genes involved in formation of the initiation complex were translationally altered during bacterial sepsis. Collectively, our findings implicate that translation shutdown is indifferent to the specific initiating pathogen and is an important determinant of tissue injury in sepsis.

We demonstrate that adipogenesis is driven by considerable remodeling of the chromatin landscape and de novo activation of enhancers, while osteogenesis involves activation of pre-established enhancers. Using machine learning algorithms for in silico modeling of transcriptional regulation we predict the repertoire of transcription factors that drive the two differentiation pathways. We show that osteoblast differentiation depends on the activation of a large and diverse transcriptional network of pro-osteogenic and anti-adipogenic transcription factors. Intriguingly, knockdown of single members of this network is sufficient to modulate differentiation in both directions, indicating that lineage-determination is a delicate balance between activities of many different transcription factors. Overall design: Genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility and enhancer activity using H3K27ac and MED1 ChIP-seq during differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells towards osteoblasts and adipocytes Raw data are not available for primary stromal cell samples due to patient privacy concerns.

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP076719",82,"Multiple Origins of Virus Persistence during Natural Control of HIV Infection","Targeted HIV cure strategies require definition of the mechanisms that maintain the virus. Here, we tracked HIV replication and the persistence of infected CD4 T cells in individuals with natural virologic control by sequencing viruses, T cell receptor genes, HIV integration sites and cellular transcriptomes. Our results revealed three mechanisms of HIV persistence operating within distinct anatomic and functional compartments. In lymph node, we detected viruses with genetic and transcriptional attributes of active replication in both T follicular helper (TFH) cells and non-TFH memory cells. In blood, we detected inducible proviruses of archival origin among highly differentiated, clonally expanded cells. Linking the lymph node and blood was a small population of circulating cells harboring inducible proviruses of recent origin. Thus, HIV replication in lymphoid tissue, clonal expansion of infected cells, and recirculation of recently infected cells act together to maintain the virus in HIV controllers despite effective antiviral immunity. Overall design: Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to sort subsets of CD4 T cells from blood (peripheral blood mononuclear cells; PBMC) and lymph node from a cohort of HIV-infected people with natural control of the virus (termed HIV controllers). Subsets of CD4 T cells that were sorted are as follows:  from blood, (1) naïve (N), (2) central memory (CM), (3) transitional memory (TM), and (4) effector memory (EM); from lymph node, (1) naïve (N), (2) non-germinal center T-follicular helpers (nGC), (3) germinal center T-follicular helpers (Tfh), (4) effector memory (EM), and (5) other central memory-like subsets (CMPD1lo57lo, CMPD1lo57hi, and/or CMPD1lo).  Total RNA and total DNA were extracted from these sorted subsets in separate fractions using RNAzol RT and DNAzol.  Total cellular DNA was used for HIV quantification and sequence analysis as describe in the publication. Total RNA used for mRNA library construction by oligo-dT purification (Dynabeads), random fragmentation by heating in the presence of Magnesium (in form of 5x first-strand buffer, LifeTech), reverse transcription (SuperScript III), and then second-strand synthesis, end repair, a-tailing, and adaptor ligation using NEBNext enzyme master mixes and oligonucleotides.

The MCPyV small tumor antigen (ST) is required for maintenance of MCC and can transform normal cells. To gain insight into cellular perturbations induced by MCPyV ST, we performed transcriptome analysis of normal human fibroblasts with inducible expression of ST. MCPyV ST dynamically alters the cellular transcriptome with increased levels of glycolytic genes, including the monocarboxylate lactate transporter SLC16A1 (MCT1). Extracellular flux analysis revealed increased lactate export reflecting elevated aerobic glycolysis in ST expressing cells. Inhibition of MCT1 activity suppressed the growth of MCC cell lines and impaired MCPyV-dependent transformation of IMR90 cells. Both NF-?B and MYC have been shown to regulate MCT1 expression. While MYC was required for MCT1 induction, MCPyV-induced MCT1 levels decreased following knockdown of the NF-?B subunit RelA, supporting a synergistic activity between MCPyV and MYC in regulating MCT1 levels. Several MCC lines had high levels of MYCL and MYCN but not MYC. Increased levels of MYCL was more effective than MYC or MYCN in increasing extracellular acidification in MCC cells. Our results demonstrate the effects of MCPyV ST on the cellular transcriptome and reveal that transformation is dependent, at least in part, on elevated aerobic glycolysis. Overall design: Expression of MCPyV ST or GFP was induced in IMR90 fibroblasts, and triplicate RNA samples were extracted and sequenced every 8 hours for a total of 96 hours"

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP091680",138,"Assessing characteristics of RNA amplification methods for single cell RNA sequencing","We conducted a large-scale control experiment to assess the transfer function of three scRNA-seq methods and factors modulating the function. Our approach was to dilute bulk total RNA (from a single source) to levels bracketing single-cell levels of total RNA (10 pg and 100 pg) in replicates and amplifying the RNA to levels sufficient for RNA sequencing. Overall design: We performed replicate transcriptome amplifications of Universal Human Reference RNA (UHR) and Human Brain Reference RNA (HBR) that were diluted to single-cell and ten-cell abundances (10 and 100 picograms (pg.) total RNA or ~200,000 and 2 million mRNA molecules, respectively) and were amplified using three single-cell RNA amplification methods. Methods included the antisense RNA IVT protocol (aRNA), a custom C1 SMARTer protocol (SmartSeq Plus) performed on a Fluidigm C1 96-well chip, and a modified NuGen Ovation RNA sequencing protocol (NuGen). Bulk ribo-depleted UHR and HBR RNA were sequenced and served as a reference. The general experimental scheme was consistent for all dilution replicates; however, there were differences across experimental groups in the specifics of experimental protocols, necessitated by particular methodologies. Because of these experimental differences, head-to-head comparison of methods is not appropriate and our goal is to provide quantitative analyses of factors affecting individual methods. Current results should be used in experimental planning, data analysis, and method optimization rather than as a performance test of any particular method. Detailed experimental design: Each collaborating center obtained reference RNA with the same lot number for Universal Human Reference (UHR) RNA (Agilent 740000, Lot 0006141415) and Human Brain Reference (HBR) (Ambion AM6050, Lot-105P055201A) and performed replicate amplification using a single amplification method, detailed below. SmartSeq Plus: Reference RNA was diluted to an intermediate stock solution by serial dilution. A final 1000-fold dilution occurred on the C1 chip, such that individual wells in a given batch contained 9.99 pg. sampled from a common intermediate dilution. ERCC spike-in RNA mix 1 (Ambion 4456740) was also added for a final mass of approximately 7 femtograms (fg.) per sample, a 4,000,000x dilution from stock. Samples for each source RNA were prepared in single batches. After amplification, cDNA from the entire C1 96-well plate was quantified using picogreen. C1 chips with an average yield of less than 3 nanograms were discarded. The top 15 reactor wells by cDNA concentration were selected as representative 10 pg. samples for sequencing library preparation. Another 50 wells were selected by the same criteria. These were pooled in sets of 10, generating 5 100 pg. samples for each HBR and UHR. All samples for a given source were prepared in a single sequencing library preparation batch using Nextera XT C1 protocol. NuGen: HBR samples were prepared in a single batch using amplification protocol 1, generating 4 10 pg. and 4 100 pg. amplified replicates. UHR samples were prepared in two batches, using either amplification protocol 1 or 2, generating 15 10 pg. and 11 100 pg. samples. A single sequencing library preparation was performed for each batch of samples using either Lucigen NxSeq or NuGen Ovation Rapid protocol. aRNA: Amplification was performed as previously described (Morris J, Singh JM, Eberwine JH. Transcriptome analysis of single cells. J. Vis. Exp. [Internet]. 2011; Available from: http://www.jove.com/video/2634/transcriptome-analysis-of-single-cells). HBR samples were prepared in 4 batches from separate dilutions of reference RNA, generating 19 10 pg. and 3 100 pg. amplified replicates. ERCC spike-ins were added to 5 of the 10 pg. replicates before amplification at a dilution of 4,000,000x from stock. UHR samples were diluted and amplified in 2 batches from separate dilutions of reference RNA, generating 12 10 pg. and 7 100 pg. amplified replicates. A single sequencing library preparation was performed using Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA protocol modified to begin with amplified aRNA. A small numbers of reads were assigned to ERCC transcripts in replicates from the batch where ERCCs had been added that did not have spike-ins added (average of 0.5% of the number of reads assigned in spiked samples). 18 additional HBR 10 pg. replicates were amplified using aRNA for protocol optimization experiments. These samples were treated separately and were excluded from primary analysis. Bulk UHR and HBR: For each reference RNA, three sequencing libraries were generated from bulk material at the same laboratory as the SmartSeq Plus replicates. Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were depleted using Ribo-Zero Gold as part of Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA protocol. Samples were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000. Because of differences in experimental design, direct comparison across methods of precision and the effect of input RNA abundance is difficult. For example, input RNA amount as a factor have different meanings for the different amplification methods: for SmartSeq Plus, because 100pg samples were constructed by pooling 10 pg. samples after cDNA amplification, any resulting effects involve library construction, while for aRNA and NuGen resulting effects reflect both cDNA amplification steps and library steps."

To better understand this biology,we characterized induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as well as their differentiated parental or re-derived counterparts. We confirmed that only iPSCs failed to respond to viral RNA,Type I interferon (IFN-I),or viral infection.  This lack of response could be phenocopied in fibroblasts with the expression of a reprogramming factor which repressed the capacity to induce canonical antiviral pathways. To ascertain the consequences of restoring the antiviral response in the context of pluripotency,we engineered a system to engage these defenses in iPSCs.    Inducible expression of a recombinant virus-activated transcription factor resulted in the successful reconstitution of antiviral defenses through the direct upregulation of IFN-I stimulated genes. Induction of the antiviral signature in iPSCs,even for a short duration,resulted in the dysregulation of genes associated with all three germ layers despite maintaining pluripotency markers. Trilineage differentiation of these same cells showed that engagement of the antiviral defenses compromised ectoderm and endoderm formation and dysregulated the development of mesodermal sublineages. In all,these data suggest that the temporal induction of the antiviral response primes iPSCs away from pluripotency and induces numerous aberrant gene products upon differentiaton. Together these results suggest that the IFN-I system and pluripotency may be incompatible with each other and thus explain why stem cells do not utilize the canonical antiviral system.

Notch signaling activation increases BC differentiation into secretory cells, but the role of individual Notch ligands in regulating this process is unknown Results: The objective of this study was to define the role of the Notch ligand JAG1 in regulating BC differentiation. JAG1 over-expression in BC increased secretory cell differentiation, with no effect on ciliated cell differentiation. Conversely, knockdown of JAG1 decreased expression of secretory cell genes. Conclusions: These data demonstrate JAG1 mediated Notch signaling regulates differentiation of BC into secretory cells. This study demonstrates that expression of the Notch ligand JAG1 is highly enriched in basal stem/progenitor cells (BC) of the human airway epithelium and that modulation of its expression levels during differentiation of BC play an important role in regulating secretory cell differentiation with no effect on ciliated cell differentiation.  These observations have implications for developing novel targets to specifically modulate levels of secretory cells in human airway disorders. Overall design: RNA sequencing of primary (Passage 0) and immortalized BC was performed on cells once they had reached 70-80% confluence. The 8 RNA-Seq samples in this submission were all normal, nonsmoker samples without any over-expression or knock-down. The 8 RNA-Seq samples show the BCiNS1.1 cell line samples to be similar to the primary basal cell (BC) samples."

HAM/TSP is a chronic progressive inflammatory neurological disorder associated with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) infection. In this chronic myelopathy, virus-infected circulating T-cells infiltrate the CNS and an immune response is initiated against the components of CNS. As the HTLV-I proviral load (PVL) has been used as the best clinical marker for patient diagnostic with HAM/TSP, we hypothesized there might be a signature on T-cell receptor (TCR) clonal repertoire in these patients, which could distinguish HAM/TSP patients from the healthy population, as well as from patients with a more heterogeneous CNS-reactive inflammatory disease as multiple sclerosis (MS). With this in mind, we applied an innovative unbiased molecular technique – unique molecular identifier (UMI) library-strategy to investigate with high accuracy the TCR clonal repertoire by high throughput sequencing (HTS) technology. cDNA-TCR ß-chain libraries were sequenced from 2 million peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 14 HAM/TSP patients, 34 MS patients and 20 healthy controls (HC). To address whether the clonal expansion correlates with the patient's PVL level, analysis of longitudinal TCR repertoire was performed in 2 HAM/TSP patients. Over 5.6 million TCR sequences were generated per sample on HiSeq 2500 Illumina system and analyzed through the molecular identifier groups-based error correction pipeline (MiGEC). Bioinformatic analysis showed that clones with more than 8 reads had a lower coefficient of variation (CV) and then could be used with confidence to evaluate the TCR clonal expansion. While HAM/TSP patients showed the higher clonal T-cell expansion compared to MS and HC, increase of the TCR clonal expansion was inversely correlated with the diversity of TCR repertoire in all subject's group. In addition, correlation of the PVL with TCR clonal expansion was observed in HAM/TSP patients at longitudinal time-points. Surprisingly, MS patients showed a higher diversity of TCR repertoire along with a very slight clonal T-cell expansion in comparison to either HAM/TSP patients or HC. Despite of the higher TCR clonal expansion in HAM/TSP patients, a non-shared or “private” TCR repertoire was observed in these patients. No clones that shared the same CDR3 amino acid sequences were seen in HC and MS patients. However, a cluster of related CDR3 amino acid sequences were observed for 18 out of 34 MS patients when evaluated by phylogenetic tree analysis. It suggestes that a TCR-repertoire signature might characterize patients with MS. Our findings suggest that even though a unique TCR-b repertoire shapes the immune response in patients with neurological immune-mediated disease, a relatedness on clonal T-cell repertoire exist in MS. Overall design: TCR-ß profiles for 68 human samples were generated via deep sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 system and reagents. Of those profiled, 20 were not diagnosed as having HAM/TSP or MS (i.e., Healthy Control, ""HC""), 14 were diagnosied as having HAM/TSP, and 34 were diagnosed as having MS."

Despite their rarity, cone photoreceptors are critical for optimal daylight vision and their loss has the greatest impact on sight during the progression of retinal dystrophies. This is most applicable to the L/M-opsin cone populations which form the largest proportion of cones in the human retina and are the only cone types present within the fovea, which is responsible for fine detailed vision. Better understanding of the early genesis of these cells within the human developing retina, particularly in relation to the expression of genes that could be involved in regulating early events such as cell fate decision, is required. These molecular determinants could be exploited in vitro to generate more cone photoreceptors within human stem cell-derived retinal differentiation culture systems, suitable for use in cell transpantation therapies or disease modelling purposes. Additionally, the nature of this cell population in terms of their gene expression heterogeneity remains to be defined.  State of the art technology has now advanced so that mRNA sequencing can be performed on individual cells, which means the transcriptome of rare cell populations such as cone photoreceptor cells can be interrogated without the need for ample material. Using the AAV2/9 pR2.1:GFP reporter, containing a synthetic promoter region previously characterised to drive expression in cone photoreceptors, we label and isolate human foetal L/M-opsin cone photoreceptors within the 15pcw human retinal retina. Isolated GFP+ cells were separated into individual cells using the Fluidigm C1 microfludics system, before RNA extraction and cDNA library preparation was performed. In total, 74 single cells were captured and processed for RNA sequencing; quality control of the data led to the inclusion of 65 individual cells for the downstream analysis. Principal component analysis revealed a very subtle heterogeneity across the cells, with the highest variability observed according to the first principal component (PC1). Differential gene expression analysis correlated to PC1 led to the identification of 503 significantly differentially expressed genes. Notably, some genes increase in expression across the cells when ordered according to PC1 which have previous associations with photoreceptor maturation, whereas other genes associated with developmental processes became downregulated across the cells. This led to the hypothesis that at this single timepoint in the human foetal retina, developing L/M-opsin cone photoreceptors exist at different stages of maturation. Overlapping genes were identified from comparing RNA seq data from 15pcw single cells and population samples at early and late timepoints of pR2.1:GFP+ cells, which showed the same gene expression trend between experiments. This suggests differences in cell maturation at a single timepoint of development could be representative of their true developmental trajectory. This overlapping gene dataset is also highly useful to define new gene that could be involved in cone photoreceptor development."

While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown. Methods: Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across 6 brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model of chronic variable stress and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Results: Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in depressed humans and in stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene DUSP6 in prefrontal cortex mimics stress susceptibility in females only by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such DUSP6 downregulation also recapitulates the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in PFC of depressed females. Conclusions: Together, our findings reveal dramatic sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder. Overall design: RNA sequencing data from (1) 6 human postmortem brain regions in males and females with and without major depression and (2) 2 epuivalent brain regions in males and female mice with and without 21 days of chronic varibale stress (CVS).

This is due in part to the heterogeneity of response following BET inhibition (BETi), which includes differentiation, senescence, and cell death in subsets of cancer cell lines.  To elucidate the dominant features defining response to BETi, we carried out phenotypic and gene expression analysis of both treatment naïve cell lines and engineered tolerant lines.  We found that both de novo and acquired tolerance to BET inhibition are driven by the robustness of the apoptotic response and that genetic or pharmacological manipulation of the apoptotic signaling network can modify the phenotypic response to BETi.  We further identify that ordered expression of the apoptotic genes BCL2, BCL2L1, and BAD significantly predicts response to BETi.  Our findings highlight the role of the apoptotic network in response to BETi, providing a molecular basis for patient stratification and combination therapies.

Importantly, we used whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) for methylation quantification to have an unbiased assessment of epigenetic modifications associated with schizophrenia, and additionally carried out whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the brain samples to account for genetic background differences. We found that a number of schizophrenia GWAS loci overlap with sites of cell-specific differential methylation in schizophrenia brain tissue. Differential methylation is also associated with differential gene expression in a cell-specific manner. Co-expression network analysis can identify groups of genes that are enriched for differentially methylated regions in each cell type, and these groups of co-expressed genes underscore shared molecular pathways that might be at risk in schizophrenia. Together, these data indicate that the integration of multiple levels of data in a cell-specific manner can provide novel biological insights into complex genetic disorders such as schizophrenia.

Current strategies that manipulate cell-cell or cell-matrix connections are difficult to constitute complex regulatory networks for cell function maintenance. Small molecules are easily combined for flexible spatiotemporal modulations, theoretically favorable for synergetic regulation of cell-innate signaling pathways to maintain cell function in vitro. Here, we developed small-molecule cocktails enabling robust maintenance of primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) longer than four weeks, with gene expression profiles, resembling those of freshly isolated PHHs; and prolong-cultured PHHs, for the first time, could maintain drug-metabolizing activities of enzymes accounting for over 80% of drug-oxidation and support hepatitis B virus infection in vitro for over one month. Our study demonstrates that this chemical approach effectively maintains terminally differentiated hepatocytes in vitro, which could be extended to various cell types. Overall design: Total of 29 samples were analyzed, which included primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) cultured in different condition in vitro. To figure out how terminally differentiated cells rapidly lose their function in vitro, two PHHs samples were compared, which included 24h-Cultured hepatocytes and fresh primary human hepatocytes (F-PHHs) [GSM2893923 and GSM2893924].

While effective genetic approaches have been developed in vitro and in animal models, these cannot be used to interrogate human physiology in vivo. Instead, naturally occurring somatic mutations have been utilized to infer clonality and lineal relationships between cells in human tissues, but current approaches are limited by high error rates and scale, and provide little information about the state or function of the cells. Here, we show how somatic mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can be tracked by current single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) or single cell ATAC-Seq (scATAC-Seq) for simultaneous analysis of single cell lineage and state. We leverage somatic mtDNA mutations as natural genetic barcodes and demonstrate their use as clonal markers to infer lineal relationships. We trace the lineage of human cells by somatic mtDNA mutations in a native context both in vitro and in vivo, and relate it to expression profiles and chromatin accessibility. Our approach should allow lineage tracing at a 100- to 1,000-fold greater scale than with single cell whole genome sequencing, while providing information on cell state, opening the way to chart detailed cell lineage and fate maps in human health and disease.

We established a system for inducing human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) via incipient mesoderm-like cells (iMeLCs).  Here, we show that EOMESODERMIN (EOMES) elevates in iMeLCs through WNT signaling and is essential for activating SOX17, a key driver for hPGC(LC) specification, with the duration/dosage of the WNT signaling/EOMES expression dictating the germ-cell competence.  Upon hPGCLC induction, BMP signaling activates TFAP2C independently from SOX17, and SOX17 and TFAP2C instate the hPGCLC program, including BLIMP1 expression, in an interdependent fashion.  The hPGC(LC) specification program is highly consistent with the monkey program, but is divergent from the mouse one regarding key transcription factors and their hierarchy of actions.  These findings delineate evolutionary divergence of mammalian germ-cell specification, providing a foundation for further human germ-cell development in vitro.

Treatment options are limited, ineffective, and for most patients, results in death in less than a year. We previously developed a first-in-field patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of NEtD. Longitudinal deep transcriptome profiling of this model enabled monitoring of dynamic transcriptional changes during NEtD and in the context of androgen deprivation. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) are implicated in cancer where they can control gene regulation. Until now the expression of lncRNAs during NEtD and their clinical associations were unexplored. RESULTS We implemented a next-generation sequence analysis pipeline that can detect transcripts at low expression levels and built a genome-wide catalogue (n=37,749) of lncRNAs. We applied this pipeline to 927 clinical samples and our high fidelity NEtD model LTL331 and identified 821 lncRNAs in NEPC. Among these are 122 lncRNAs that robustly distinguish NEPC from prostate adenocarcinoma (AD) patient tumours. The highest expressed lncRNAs within this signature are H19, LINC00617, and SSTR5-AS1. Another 742 are associated with the NEtD process and fall into four distinct patterns of expression (NEtD lncRNA Class I, II, III, and IV) in our PDX model and clinical samples. Each class has significant (z-scores>2) and unique enrichment for transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs in their sequences. Enriched TFBS include (1) TP53 and BRN1 in Class I, (2) ELF5, SPIC, and HOXD1 in Class II, (3) SPDEF in Class III, (4) HSF1 and FOXA1 in Class IV, and (5) TWIST1 when merging Class III with IV. Common TFBS in all NEtD lncRNA were also identified and include, E2F, REST, PAX5, PAX9, and STAF. Interrogation of the top deregulated candidates (n=100) in radical prostatectomy adenocarcinoma samples with long-term follow-up (median 18 years) revealed significant clinicopathological associations. Specifically, we identified 25 that are associated with rapid metastasis following androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Two of these lncRNAs (SSTR5-AS1 and LINC00514) stratified patients undergoing ADT based on patient outcome. DISCUSSION To date, a comprehensive characterization of the dynamic landscape of lncRNAs during the NEtD process has not been performed. A temporal analysis of the PDX-based NEtD model has for the first time provided this dynamic landscape. TFBS analysis identified NEPC-related TF motifs present within the NEtD lncRNA sequences, suggesting functional roles for these lncRNAs in NEPC pathogenesis. Furthermore, select NEtD lncRNAs appear to be associated with metastasis and patients receiving ADT. Treatment-related metastasis is a clinical consequence of NEPC tumours. Top candidate lncRNAs FENDRR, H19, LINC00514, LINC00617, and SSTR5-AS1 identified in this study are implicated in the development of NEPC. We present here for the first time a genome-wide catalogue of NEtD lncRNAs that characterize the transdifferentiation process and a robust NEPC lncRNA patient expression signature. To accomplish this, we carried out the largest integrative study that applied a PDX NEtD model to clinical samples. These NEtD and NEPC lncRNAs are strong candidates for clinical biomarkers and therapeutic targets and warrant further investigation."

While known as main effector of Notch signaling, it can also play Notch-independent functions. Despite the wide interest in CSL, the mechanisms responsible for its own regulation have been little studied. We recently showed that CSL down-modulation in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) leads to conversion into cancer associated fibroblasts, which promote keratinocyte tumor development. We show here that levels of CSL gene transcription differ among HDF strains derived from many different individuals, with negative correlation with genes involved in DNA damage/repair. CSL expression in all tested strains is negatively regulated by stress / DNA damaging insults caused by UVA, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), smoke extract and doxorubicin treatment. p53, a key effector of the DNA damage response, functions as common negative regulator of CSL gene transcription, through both suppression of CSL promoter activity and, indirectly, through increased p21 expression. CSL was previously shown to bind p53 suppressing its activity. The present findings indicate that p53, in turn, decreases CSL expression, which can serve to enhance p53 activity in the acute response of cells to DNA damaging cancer-threatening conditions.

In stark contrast Reston ebolavirus (RESTV) might be non-pathogenic for humans yet the underlying mechanisms determining pathogenicity for different Ebola viruses are not understood. In this study we investigate antiviral immune responses in EBOV- and RESTV- infected primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). We provide evidence that increased pathogenicity of the highly pathogenic EBOV is associated with a strong activation of host responses from infected MDM. The observed cytokine response after EBOV infection is strikingly similar to LPS-mediated immune signatures however EBOV caused significant induction of the interferon response in addition. In contrast we show that the low pathogenic RESTV fails to elicit significant immune responses in infected MDM. These results demonstrate a correlation of pathogenicity and excessive MDM activation for different Ebola virus species. Interaction of the viral glycoprotein (GP) with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) leading to activation of NF_B signaling is responsible for this effect rather than differences in replication or blocking of immune signaling. We demonstrate that inhibition of TLR4 is able to abolish EBOV-GP mediated NF_B activation which might offer the possibility to develop targeted treatments for EBOV limiting the extreme immune response that seems to be detrimental to the host.

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP045352",56,"Comparative Analysis of Transcriptional Responses in Monocytes from Human Neonates, Adults, and Older Adults","Human neonates and older adults frequently exhibit a reduced capacity to control microbial infections. A variety of mechanisms involving both the innate and adaptive immune systems have been proposed to contribute to these deficiencies. The emergence of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) as an accurate and quantitative method for examining mRNA levels provides an opportunity to compare transcriptional responses to a stimulus at a global scale in neonates, adults, and older adults. An examination of ex vivo monocyte responses to lipopolysaccharide stimulation or Listeria monocytogenes infection (with cord blood monocytes representing neonatal monocytes) revealed extensive similarities between all three age groups, with only a small number of genes exhibiting statistically significant differences. Using transcription factor motif analyses and RNA-seq data sets from a variety of mouse mutants, the most significant neonatal deficiencies corresponded to genes that require interferon response factor-3 or type 1 interferon signaling for their activation. In older adults, the most striking difference was broad, low-level activation of inflammatory genes prior to stimulation, consistent with prior evidence of a chronic inflammatory state in older adults. These results demonstrate the value of quantitative RNA-seq analyses and the feasibility of cross-species comparisons between well-defined mouse networks and human data sets.

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP108852",133,"Genome-scale Activation Screen Identifies a LncRNA Locus Regulating a Gene Neighborhood [RNA-Seq]","The mammalian genome contains thousands of loci that transcribe long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), some of which are known to play critical roles in diverse cellular processes through a variety of mechanisms. While some lncRNA loci encode RNAs that act non-locally (in trans), emerging evidence indicates that many lncRNA loci act locally (in cis) to regulate expression of nearby genes—for example, through functions of the lncRNA promoter, transcription, or transcript itself. Despite their potentially important roles, it remains challenging to identify functional lncRNA loci and distinguish among these and other mechanisms. To address these challenges, we developed a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 activation screen targeting more than 10,000 lncRNA transcriptional start sites (TSSs) to identify noncoding loci that influence a phenotype of interest. We found 11 novel lncRNA loci that, upon recruitment of an activator, each mediate BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma. Most candidate loci appear to regulate nearby genes. Detailed analysis of one candidate, termed EMICERI, revealed that its transcriptional activation results in dosage-dependent activation of four neighboring protein-coding genes, one of which confers the resistance phenotype. Our screening and characterization approach provides a CRISPR toolkit to systematically discover functions of noncoding loci and elucidate their diverse roles in gene regulation and cellular function. Overall design: RNA-seq on A375 cells overexpressing candidate lncRNA or protein-coding gene."

Overall design: 208 children with exacerbation prone asthma were enrolled according to the inclusion criteria. Each child had baseline samples collected and were prospectively monitored for the onset of cold symptoms (Events) during a 6 month period. 106/208 children came in during one or more events and had sufficient samples collected for analysis. Events were grouped as exacerbation associated (Ex+) or not exacerbation associated (Ex-) depending on whether the event lead to clinical symptoms that resulted in systemic corticosteroid use within 10 days of event onset or resolved without treatment with systemic corticosteroids.

Here we establish an integrated imaging-genomic discovery platform using primary human heart fibroblasts to identify new drug targets for cardiac fibrosis. Genome wide analyses identify IL11, a secreted cytokine amenable to therapeutic inhibition, as the leading pro-fibrotic candidate. We demonstrate an autocrine loop of IL11 activity that is critical for fibrosis and acts as a nexus of signalling convergence for multiple pro-fibrotic stimuli. IL11 signals in cis and trans via the ERK cascade to activate a programme of fibrosis primarily at the level of protein translation. Injection of IL11 to mice causes fibrosis of the heart, kidney, lung, skin and liver whereas genetic ablation of the IL11 receptor prevented fibrosis across tissues. These data define a new non-canonical fibrogenic pathway and prioritise IL11 as a novel therapeutic target for fibrosis of the heart and other organs Overall design: 168 human cardiac fibroblasts. 84 control, 84 TGFB1 induced.

We hypothesized that lung stromal cells activate pathological gene expression programs supporting oncogenesis. To identify molecular mechanisms operating in the lung stroma that support development of lung cancer. Study subjects included patients with- or without- lung cancer across a spectrum of lung function. We conducted multi-omics analysis of non-malignant lung tissue to quantify the transcriptome, translatome and proteome. Cancer-associated gene expression changes predominantly manifested as alterations in the efficiency of mRNA translation modulating protein levels in the absence of corresponding changes in mRNA levels. The molecular mechanisms driving these cancer-associated translation programs differed based on lung function. In subjects with normal to mildly impaired lung-function, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway served as an upstream driver; whereas in severe airflow obstruction, pathways downstream of pathological extracellular matrix (ECM) emerged. Consistent with a role during cancer initiation, both the mTOR and ECM gene expression programs paralleled activation of previously identified pro-cancer secretomes. Furthermore, in situ examination of lung tissue documented that stromal fibroblasts express cancer-associated proteins from the two pro-cancer secretomes including IL6 in mild or no airflow obstruction and BMP1 in severe airflow obstruction. Two distinct stromal gene expression programs promoting cancer initiation are activated in lung cancer patients depending on lung function. Our work has implications both for screening strategies and personalized approaches to cancer treatment.

For the available limited collections of normal tissues from post mortal donors, there is a problem of data incompatibility, as different datasets were generated using different experimental platforms and cannot be merged in a single panel. Here, for the first time, we construct and deposited a gene expression database of normal human tissues based on uniformly screened original sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 3000) data. A total of 148 solid tissue samples representing 20 organs were taken from post-mortal human healthy donors killed in road accidents no later than 36 hours after death. Blood and bone marrow samples were taken from 6 and 11 healthy volunteers respectively. The materials were collected since 2012 and stored until gene expression profiles were obtained by using the same reagents and protocols. Data consistency was confirmed by hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA). Our data can be useful to all those working with the analysis of human gene expression. Overall design: A total of 148 solid tissue samples representing 20 organs were taken from post-mortal human healthy donors killed in road accidents no later than 36 hours after death.

In order to identify pharmacodynamic biomarkers and assess differential effects of TNF- and non–TNF-targeting agents on RA patients with an inadequate response to anti-TNF–IR in comparison with biologic-naïve patients, peripheral protein markers and gene expression levels in association with clinical response posttreatment in two disease strata were assessed in disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-IR and anti-TNF-IR patients. Serum proteomics results indicated the existence of specific pharmacodynamic markers for golimumab and mavrilimumab, regardless of prior anti-TNF treatment. In contrast, both antibodies induced early and sustained suppression of RA disease markers, including IL-6, CRP, IL2RA, and MMP1, in DMARD-IR patients. Golimumab-induced early changes rapidly returned toward baseline concentrations in anti-TNF–IR patients, whereas mavrilimumab-induced changes were maintained through Day 169. RNA sequencing demonstrated gene expression changes at Day 169 after administration of mavrilimumab but not golimumab in anti-TNF–IR patients. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic curve and regression analysis showed the association of early IL-6 change and subsequent clinical responses to golimumab in anti-TNF-IR patients. Our results revealed golimumab- and mavrilimumab-specific pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and demonstrated differential biomarker-treatment relationships in anti-TNF–IR and DMARD-IR patients respectively. Early IL-6 change after anti-TNF antibody treatment may be a potential predictive biomarker for selection of different treatment regimens in anti-TNF-IR patients. Overall design: For RNAseq study, PAXgene whole blood tubes were collected from 75 DMARD-IR and 63 anti-TNF-IR RA patients at baseline and at day 169 of post-treatment by golimumab and marvrilimumab. Whole transcriptome profiles of these patients and 20 health donors were generated from RNAseq data.

Here, using human adipose stem cell-derived adipocytes, we demonstrate that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were enriched at sites of patient-specific PPARg binding, which correlated with the individual-specific effects of TZD rosiglitazone (rosi) on gene expression. Rosi induction of ABCA1, which regulates cholesterol metabolism, was dependent upon SNP rs4743771, which modulated PPARg binding by influencing the genomic occupancy of its cooperating factor NFIA. Conversion of rs4743771 from the inactive SNP allele to the active one by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing rescued PPARg binding as well as rosi-induction of ABCA1 expression. Moreover, rs4743771 is a major determinant of undesired serum cholesterol increases in rosi-treated diabetics.

While targeted therapies have yielded success in BRAFV600 mutant melanoma patients, such therapies have been ineffective in NRAS mutant melanomas in part due to their cytostatic effects and primary resistance in this patient population. Here, we demonstrate that increased Rho/MRTF-pathway activation correlates with high intrinsic resistance to trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, in a panel of NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines. Combination of trametinib with the Rho/MRTF-pathway inhibitor, CCG-222740, synergistically reduced cell viability in NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines in vitro. Furthermore, the combination of CCG-222740 with trametinib induced apoptosis and reduced clonogenicity in the highly trametinib-resistant SK-Mel-147 cells. These findings suggest a role of the Rho/MRTF-pathway in high intrinsic trametinib resistance to a subset of NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines and highlights the potential of concurrently targeting the Rho/MRTF-pathway and MEK in NRAS mutant melanomas.

Therefore, this study focuses on the integration of single-cell RNA-seq data with bulk ChIP-seq and other epigenetics data, for which single-cell technologies are not yet established, in the context of BPs.We performed integrative analyses of novel human single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data with bulk ChIP-seq and other epigenetics data. scRNA-seq data revealed distinct transcription states of BPs that were previously not recognized. We find associations between these transcription states to distinct patterns in structural gene features, DNA accessibility, histone modification, DNA methylation and TF binding profiles.Our results suggest that a complex interplay of all of these elements is required to achieve BP-specific transcriptional output in this specialized promoter configuration.

RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful technique to investigate the complexity of gene expression in the human brain. We used RNA-seq to survey the brain transcriptome in high-quality post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 11 individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BD) and from 11 age- and gender-matched controls.  Deep sequencing was performed, with over 350 million reads per specimen. At a false-discovery rate of <5%, we detected 5 differentially-expressed (DE) genes and 12 DE transcripts, most of which have not been previously implicated in BD.  Among these, PROM1/CD133 and ABCG2 play important roles in neuroplasticity. We also show for the first time differential expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in BD.  DE transcripts include those of SRSF5 and RFX4, which along with lncRNAs play a role in mammalian circadian rhythms. The DE genes were significantly enriched for several Gene Ontology (GO) categories. Of these, genes involved with GTPase binding were also enriched for BD-associated SNPs from previous genome-wide association studies, suggesting that differential expression of these genes is not simply a consequence of BD or its treatment.  Many of these findings were replicated by microarray in an independent sample of 60 cases and controls. These results highlight common pathways for inherited and non-inherited influences on disease risk that may constitute good targets for novel therapies.

We used integrative genomics to explore BCL6 mechanism in normal and malignant B-cells. Surprisingly, BCL6 assembled distinct complexes at enhancers vs. promoters. At enhancers BCL6 preferentially recruited SMRT, which mediated H3K27 deacetylation through HDAC3, antagonized p300 activity and repressed transcription, but without decommissioning enhancers. This provides a biochemical basis for toggling enhancers from the active to poised state. Virtually all SMRT was bound with BCL6 suggesting that in B-cells BCL6 uniquely sequesters SMRT from other factors. In promoters BCL6 preferentially recruited BCOR, but most potently repressed promoters where it formed a distinctive ternary complex with SMRT and BCOR. Promoter repression was associated with decreased H3K36me3, H3K79me2 and Pol II elongation, linking BCL6 to transcriptional pausing. Overall design: We identified the binding patterns of BCL6, SMRT, NCOR and BCOR corepressors in normal germinal center B cells and a DLBCL cell line (OCI-Ly1) using ChIP-seq. Additionally we treated lymphoma cells with siRNA against BCL6 and a non-targeted siRNA (NT control) and performed RNA-seq to identify the genes bound and repressed by BCL6. RNA-seq experiments were performed at 24h and 48h after siRNA treatments. Additional biological triplicate RNA-seq experiments were performed at 48h after BCL6 knockdown. Furthermore, a series of histone mark ChIP-seq and RNA polymerase ChIP-seq (total, Ser5-P and Ser2-P) were preformed to capture the chromatin states associated with the formation of BCL6 corepressor complexes."

However, these methods have not been systematically and comprehensively benchmarked. Here, we directly compare seven methods for single cell and/or single nucleus profiling from three types of samples – cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and brain tissue – generating 36 libraries in six separate experiments in a single center. To analyze these datasets, we developed and applied scumi, a flexible computational pipeline that can be used for any scRNA-seq method. We evaluated the methods for both basic performance and for their ability to recover known biological information in the samples. Our study will help guide experiments with the methods in this study as well as serve as a benchmark for future studies and for computational algorithm development. Overall design: We systematically and directly compared seven single cell RNA-sequencing methods, including two low-throughput plate-based methods (Smart-seq2 and CEL-Seq2) and five high-throughput methods (10x Chromium (v2, v3), Drop-seq, Seq-Well, inDrops, and sci-RNA-seq), producing expression profiles from ~92,000 cells (nuclei) overall. We tested three sample types – a mixture of human and mouse cell lines, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and mouse cortex, each sample with two replicates – to generate a total of 36 different single cell RNA-sequencing libraries. For mouse cortex, we tested four single nucleus RNA-sequencing methods (Smart-seq2, 10x Chromium (v2), DroNc-seq, and sci-RNA-seq). We tested each sample type in two experiments (Mixture1 and Mixture2, PBMC1 and PBMC2, Cortex1 and Cortex2) run on different days to assess reproducibility. In each comparison experiment, we started with one sample with processing of aliquots starting at the same time for each method. The only exceptions were for Seq-Well in PBMC1, in which we thawed an identical PBMC aliquot a second time to obtain a Seq-Well dataset with sufficient cells profiled for PBMCs, and for 10x Chromium in PBMC1, in which we thawed an identical aliquot to directly compare version 2 (v2) with version 3 (v3). In each experiment, we aimed to collect data from ~350 cells for the low-throughput methods and ~3,000 cells for the high-throughput methods. In each experiment, we also used an aliquot of cells to generate a bulk RNA-sequencing library as a control. We sequenced all libraries together in an attempt to avoid batch effects due to varying sequence quality among Illumina flowcell lanes, with the following exceptions. We sequenced the inDrops libraries separately because they have an opposite read structure from those generated with the other methods. We performed additional sequencing for some libraries in an attempt to sequence similar numbers of reads per cell for each low or high throughput method. We aimed for 50,000 to 100,000 reads per cell for high-throughput methods and 750,000 to 1,000,000 reads per cell for low-throughput methods.

Using highly-purified mDC isolated from individuals with naturally-acquired acute infection, we here show that ZIKV induces profound perturbations of transcriptional signatures relative to uninfected patients. Interestingly, we noted a remarkable downregulation of antiviral Interferon-stimulated genes and innate immune sensors, suggesting that ZIKV can actively suppress Interferon-dependent immune responses. In contrast, several host factors known to support ZIKV infection were strongly upregulated during natural ZIKV infection; these transcripts included AXL, the main entry receptor for ZIKV, SOCS3, a negative regulator of ISG expression, and IDO-1, a recognized inducer of regulatory T cell responses.

This has been designed by computer modelling, is a potent inhibitor of cell growth in PDAC cell lines and has anti-cancer activity in PDAC models, with a superior profile compared to gemcitabine, a commonly used therapy.   Whole-transcriptome RNA-seq methodology has been used to analyse for the first time the effects of a quadruplex-binding small molecule on gene expression. This has revealed the down-regulation of a large number of genes, rich in putative quadruplex elements and involved in essential pathways of PDAC survival, metastasis and drug resistance.

Prior work has demonstrated that cigarette smoke creates a molecular “field of injury” throughout the airway epithelium and that there are distinct alterations in the airway transcriptome among smokers who have lung cancer. Molecular characterization of this airway “field of injury” in current and former smokers with premalignant lesions (PMLs) could provide novel insights into the earliest molecular events associated with lung carcinogenesis and identify relatively accessible biomarkers to guide lung cancer detection and early intervention. Using mRNA sequencing (mRNA-Seq), we profiled 82 cytologically normal bronchial airway epithelial cells collected during autofluorescence bronchoscopy from high-risk smokers with and without bronchial PMLs, 75 of which were used in downstream analyses. We identified 280 genes differentially expressed in the “field of injury” between subjects with (n=50)  and without (n=25) PMLs (FDR<0.002), 81 of which were up-regulated in subjects with PMLs. Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the electron transport chain (ETC), and mitochondrial protein transport pathways were strongly enriched among these up-regulated genes (FDR<0.05). We next demonstrated that OXPHOS activation is shared between the “field” and the PMLs with increased oxygen consumption and increased staining for mitochondrial markers in biopsies of PMLs from patients as well as an animal model of lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) premalignancy. The 280-gene signature also has a significant concordant relationship to gene expression changes identified in PMLs adjacent to lung SCC tumors, in lung SCC tumors, and in the cytologically normal airway of individuals with lung cancer (FDR<0.05).  These findings suggest that these expression changes are reflective of early cancer-associated changes occurring throughout the respiratory tract, and that pathways such as OXPHOS may be targets for chemoprevention.  We subsequently developed an airway gene expression biomarker that predicts the presence of PMLs (AUC=0.92, n=17 samples in test set) and show that changes in the biomarker score are associated with progression and regression of PMLs in an independent cohort (AUC=0.75, n=51 samples). The biomarker results indicate that molecular alterations in the field of injury are dynamic with progression or regression of PMLs, suggesting that these changes may be leveraged to stratify high-risk smokers with progressive disease into early intervention trials and monitor disease progression or recurrence. Overall design: 82 mRNA-Seq samples from 25 smokers without PMLs, 50 smokers with PMLs, and 7 smokers with metaplasia."

Known as human Wharton's jelly stem cells (hWJSCs), they have broad differentiation potential, are proliferative and available in large numbers from discarded cords thus requiring minimum ex vivo expansion. They are safe and non-tumorigenic and maintain stemness properties for prolonged periods in culture. Besides their potential to produce tissues for cell based therapies, it has been demonstrated that they have anti-cancer and wound healing properties and provide cues for expansion of hematopoietic stem cells for treatment of hematopoietic malignancies. They are thus an attractive alternative source of MSCs of therapeutic value compared to bone marrow MSCs (hBMMSCs). We aimed to characterise the differences in gene expression profiles between these two stem cell types using single cell RNA sequencing to determine which pathways are involved in conferring hWJSCs with their unique properties. Overall design: One hundred and three hWJSCs and sixty-three hBMMSCs. There are no replicates."

Purpose: To characterise the cellular/molecular mechanisms underlying infant AVB in circulating cells/local airways tissues. Methods: PBMC and nasal mucosal scrapings (NMS) were obtained from Infants (<18mths) and children (1.5-5yrs) during AVB and post-convalescence. Immune response patterns were profiled by multiplex analysis of plasma cytokines, flow cytometry, and transcriptomics (RNA-Seq). Molecular profiling of group-level data utilised a combination of upstream regulator and coexpression network analysis, followed by individual subject-level data analysis employing personalised N-of-1-pathways methodology. Results: Group-level analyses demonstrated that infant PBMC responses were dominated by monocyte-associated hyper-upregulated type I interferon signalling/pro-inflammatory pathways (drivers: TNF, IL6, TREM1, IL1B), versus a combination of inflammation (PTGER2, IL6) plus growth/repair/remodelling pathways (ERBB2, TGFB1, AREG, HGF) coupled with Th2 and NK-cell signalling in children. Age-related differences were not attributable to differential steroid usage or variations in underlying viral pathogens. Nasal mucosal responses were comparable qualitatively in infants/children, dominated by interferon types I-III, but the magnitude of upregulation was higher in infants (range 6-48-fold) than children (5-17-fold). N-of-1-pathways analysis confirmed differential upregulation of innate immunity in infants and NK cell networks in children, and additionally demonstrated covert AVB response sub-phenotypes that were independent of chronological age. Conclusions: Dysregulated expression of interferon-dependent pathways following respiratory viral infections is a defining immunophenotypic feature of AVB-susceptible infants and a subset of children. Susceptible subjects appear to represent a discrete subgroup who cluster based on (slow) kinetics of postnatal maturation of innate immune competence. Overall design: The study design consisted of PBMC from infants (<18months, n=15 pairs) and pre-school children (2-5yrs, n=16 pairs) sampled during severe acute viral bronchiolitis (acute visit = AV) and following recovery during convalescence (convalescent visit = CV).

Exosomes are nano-sized extracellular vesicles that contain molecules characteristic of their cell-of-origin, including microRNA. Exosomes released by glioblastoma tumors cross the blood-brain-barrier ino the peripheral circulation. Methods: Serum exosomal-microRNA isolated from IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (n=12) and IDH-mutant glioma grades II-III (n=10) were analyzed using small-RNA next generation sequencing and compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Differentially expressed miRNAs (|fold change|³2 and p-value?=?0.05 in three statistical tests, Fischer-exact, t-test, and Wilcoxon) were identified and the predictive power of individual and subsets of miRNAs were tested using univariate (logistic regression) and multivariate (Random Forest) analyses. Additional glioblastoma sera (n=4) and independent sets of healthy (n=9) and non-glioma (n=10) controls were used to further test the predictive power of our glioblastoma miRNA signature. Results: Twenty-six miRNAs were differentially expressed in glioblastoma relative to healthy controls. Seven miRNAs (miR-182-5p, miR-328-3p, miR-339-5p, miR-340-5p, miR-485-3p, miR-486-5p and miR-543) were the most stable for classifying glioblastoma, achieving a predictive power of 91.7%. Strikingly, the combined expressions of miR-182-5p, miR-328-3p miR-485-3p miR-486-5p distinguished glioblastoma patients from controls with perfect accuracy. This miRNA panel was able to correctly classify all specimens in validation cohorts (n=23). An analogous approach was used to identify 23 dysregulated miRNAs in IDH-mutant gliomas, including a distinct subset of stable miRNAs for classifying patients with lower-grade IDH-mutant gliomas. Conclusions: Our serum exosomal-miRNA signature can accurately diagnose glioblastoma preoperatively. These findings have significant scope to revolutionize glioblastoma tumor diagnosis and disease monitoring. IMPORTANCE OF STUDY: There is a real need for accurate biomarkers that can measure glioblastoma disease activity and treatment response in a safe and timely manner. This study demonstrates that exosome-associated microRNAs have exceptional utility as blood-based biomarkers in glioma patients. This work also shows the potential for exosomal microRNA profiles to be used for glioma subtyping, grading and determining mutational states. The development of specific, sensitive and non-invasive screening tests would have significant clinical benefit by reducing costs of treatment monitoring, improving accessibility and quality-of-life measures. Moreover, such tests have the potential to provide objectively measured surrogate endpoints to allow clinical trial protocols to be more dynamic and adaptive. Overall design: Serum exosomal miRNA profiles ofIDH-wildtype glioblastoma, IDH-mutant glioma grades II-III, their matched healthy controls, and additional GBM patients, non_GBM patients and healthy controls were generated by deep sequencing, single end, using Illumina HiSeq. 2000 System at the Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics."

Transcription factor network analyses reveal that Vpu suppresses the expression of NF-?B rather than IRF3 target genes. As a result, Vpu impairs the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFNß, CXCL10 and IL-6.

These include near ubiquitous pathological inclusions of the RNA binding protein (RBP) TDP-43, and often the presence of a GGGGCC expansion in the C9ORF72 (C9) gene. Here we show unexpectedly that the signature of hnRNP H sequestration and altered splicing of target transcripts we identified in C9ALS patients (Conlon et al. 2016) also occurs in fully half of 50 post-mortem sporadic, non-C9 ALS/FTD post-mortem brains. Furthermore, and equally surprisingly, these “like-C9” brains also contained correspondingly high amounts of insoluble TDP-43, as well as several other disease-related RBPs, and this correlates with widespread global splicing defects. Finally, we show that the like-C9 sporadic patients, like actual C9ALS patients, were much more likely to have developed FTD. We propose that these unexpected links between C9 and sporadic ALS/FTD define a common mechanism in this disease spectrum.

Novel and targetable mutations are needed for improved understanding and treatment of lung cancer in never-smokers. Methods. Twenty-seven lung adenocarcinomas from never-smokers were sequenced by both exome and mRNA-seq with respective normal tissues. Somatic mutations were detected and compared with pathway deregulation, tumor phenotypes and clinical outcomes. Results. Although somatic mutations in DNA or mRNA ranged from hundreds to thousands in each tumor, the overlap mutations between the two were only a few to a couple of hundreds. The number of somatic mutations from either DNA or mRNA was not significantly associated with clinical variables; however, the number of overlap mutations was associated with cancer subtype. These overlap mutants were preferentially expressed in mRNA with consistently higher allele frequency in mRNA than in DNA. Ten genes (EGFR, TP53, KRAS, RPS6KB2, ATXN2, DHX9, PTPN13, SP1, SPTAN1 and MYOF) had recurrent mutations and these mutations were highly correlated with pathway deregulation and patient survival. Conclusions. The recurrent mutations present in both DNA and RNA are likely the driver for tumor biology, pathway deregulation and clinical outcomes.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 130 independent loci that influence CAD risk, most of which reside in non-coding regions of the genome. To interpret these loci, we generated transcriptome and whole-genome datasets using human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC) from 52 unrelated donors, as well as ATAC-seq epigenomic datasets on a subset of 8 donors. Through systematic comparison with publicly available datasets from GTEx and ENCODE projects, we identify transcriptomic, epigenetic, and genetic regulatory mechanisms specific to HCASMC. We validate the relevance of HCASMC to CAD risk using transcriptomic and epigenomic level analyses. By jointly modeling eQTL and GWAS datasets, we identified five genes (SIPA1, TCF21, SMAD3, FES, and PDGFRA) that modulate CAD risk through HCASMC, all of which have biologically relevant functional roles in vascular remodeling. Comparison with GTEx data suggests that SIPA1 appears to influence CAD risk predominantly through HCASMC, while other annotated genes may have multiple cell targets. Together, these results provide new biological insights into the regulation of a critical vascular cell type associated with CAD in human populations.

Therapies targeting specific upstream drivers of asthma have had variable results. We hypothesized that an a priori-knowledge independent approach would point to new therapies for airway goblet cell metaplasia. We analyzed the transcriptome of an organotypic model of human goblet cell metaplasia. We combined our data with previously published datasets from IL13-exposed in vitro and asthmatic in vivo human airway epithelial cells. The drug perturbation-response connectivity approach identified the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor geldanamycin as a candidate for reverting airway goblet cell metaplasia. We found that geldanamycin not only prevented but reverted IL13-induced goblet cell metaplasia. Geldanamycin did not induce goblet cell death, did not solely block mucin synthesis, and did not block IL13 receptor-proximal signaling. Moreover, the transcriptional effects of geldanamycin were absent in unstimulated cells and became evident only after stimulation with IL13. The predicted mechanism of action suggested that geldanamycin should also revert IL17-induced goblet cell metaplasia, a prediction confirmed by our data. Our findings suggest HSP90 activity may be required for persistence of goblet cell metaplasia driven by various mechanisms in chronic lung diseases. Overall design: For both batches, airway epithelia cultures from the lungs of eight different humans were studied, therefore, there are eight biological replicates. Comparisons should be made within batches. In batch 1 (XAM1), epithelia were exposed to vehicle (DMSO 0.5%),   geldanamycin 25 uM, or the HDAC6 inhibitor ISOX 10 uM for 48 hours.

Previously, we did not detect evidence of immune dysregulation or virus reactivation outside of PEM periods. Here we sought to determine whether cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing of ME/CFS patients could trigger such changes. ME/CFS patients (n=14) and matched sedentary controls (n=11) were subjected to cardiopulmonary exercise on 2 consecutive days and followed up to 7 days post-exercise, and longitudinal whole blood samples analyzed by RNA-seq. Although ME/CFS patients showed significant worsening of symptoms following exercise versus controls, with 8 of 14 ME/CFS patients showing oxygen consumption (V?O2) on day 2, transcriptome analysis yielded only 6 differentially expressed gene (DEG) candidates when comparing ME/CFS patients to controls across all time points. None of the DEGs were related to immune signaling, and no DEGs were found in ME/CFS patients before and after exercise. Virome composition (P=0.746 by chi-square test) and number of viral reads (P = 0.098 by paired t-test) were not significantly associated with PEM. These observations do not support transcriptionally-mediated immune cell dysregulation or viral reactivation in ME/CFS patients during symptomatic PEM episodes. Overall design: RNAseq of whole blood samples from ME/CFS patients and controls following exercise."

Clinical manipulation of Tregs is of great interest, and first-in-man trials of Treg transfer achieved promising outcomes. Yet, the mechanisms governing induced Treg (iTreg) differentiation and the regulation of FOXP3 are incompletely understood. Results: To gain a comprehensive and unbiased molecular understanding of FOXP3 induction, we performed time-series RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and proteomics profiling on the same samples during human iTreg differentiation. To enable the broad analysis of universal FOXP3-inducing pathways, we used five differentiation protocols in parallel. Integrative analysis of the transcriptome and proteome confirmed involvement of specific molecular processes, as well as overlap of a novel iTreg subnetwork with known Treg regulators and autoimmunity-associated genes. Importantly, we propose 37 novel molecules putatively involved in iTreg differentiation. Their relevance was validated by: a targeted shRNA screen confirming a functional role in FOXP3 induction; discriminant analyses classifying iTregs accordingly; and comparable expression in an independent novel iTreg RNA Seq data set. Conclusion: The data generated by this novel approach facilitate understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying iTreg generation as well as the concomitant changes in the transcriptome and proteome. Our results provide a reference map exploitable for future discovery of markers and drug candidates governing control of Tregs, which has important implications for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases Overall design: Comparing the gene expression in activated CD4+ cells and iTreg differentiated cells in human. 10 time points, 3 biological replicates for each time point."

Upper respiratory tract pneumococcal carriage is important as both determinants of disease and population transmission. The immunological mechanisms that contain pneumococcal carriage are well-studied in mice but remain unclear in humans. Loss of this control of carriage following influenza infection is associated with secondary bacterial pneumonia during seasonal and pandemic outbreaks. We used a human type 6B pneumococcal challenge model to show that carriage acquisition induces early degranulation of resident neutrophils and recruitment of monocytes to the nose. Monocyte function associated with clearance of pneumococcal carriage. Prior nasal infection with live attenuated influenza virus induced inflammation, impaired innate function and altered genome-wide nasal gene responses to pneumococcal carriage. Levels of the cytokine IP-10 promoted by viral infection at the time of pneumococcal encounter was positively associated with bacterial density. These findings provide novel insights in nasal immunity to pneumococcus and viral-bacterial interactions during co-infection. Overall design: 96 nasal samples from healthy volunteers experimentally challenged with pneumococcus, 3  days after receiving live attenuated influenza vaccine or tetravalent inactivated influenza vaccine underwent RNA-Sequencing.

In the case of cancer, slow-cycling subpopulations have been proposed to give rise to drug resistance. However, the origin of slow-cycling human cells is poorly studied, in large part due to lack of markers to identify these rare cells. Slow-cycling cells pass through a non-cycling period marked by low CDK2 activity and high p21 levels. Here, we use this knowledge to isolate these naturally slow-cycling cells from a heterogeneous population and perform RNA-sequencing to delineate the transcriptome underlying the slow-cycling state. We show that cellular stress responses – the p53 transcriptional response and the integrated stress response – are the most salient causes of spontaneous entry into the slow-cycling state.

To accelerate characterization of the “long tail” of rare somatic variants, we quantified the activity and drug responsiveness of virtually all possible (99.84%) missense variants in the Ser/Thr kinase MAPK1/ERK2. We identified recurrent and rare hypermorphic and loss-of-function alleles, revealing that variant activity is uncorrelated with mutational frequency. Somatic ERK2 variants displayed variable responses to RAF-, MEK- and ERK-directed therapies, potentially informing clinical treatment strategies for patients whose tumors harbor these alterations. A subset of recurrent and rare somatic variants co-localized on ERK2 protein-protein interfaces, yet engendered contrasting phenotypes based on their specific sub-domain localization. The approach presented here represents an allele-characterization framework that compliments existing computational efforts and supports current and future somatic variant discovery efforts, advancing the promise of genome-guided treatment strategies.

While effective genetic approaches have been developed in vitro and in animal models, these cannot be used to interrogate human physiology in vivo. Instead, naturally occurring somatic mutations have been utilized to infer clonality and lineal relationships between cells in human tissues, but current approaches are limited by high error rates and scale, and provide little information about the state or function of the cells. Here, we show how somatic mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can be tracked by current single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) or single cell ATAC-Seq (scATAC-Seq) for simultaneous analysis of single cell lineage and state. We leverage somatic mtDNA mutations as natural genetic barcodes and demonstrate their use as clonal markers to infer lineal relationships. We trace the lineage of human cells by somatic mtDNA mutations in a native context both in vitro and in vivo, and relate it to expression profiles and chromatin accessibility. Our approach should allow lineage tracing at a 100- to 1,000-fold greater scale than with single cell whole genome sequencing, while providing information on cell state, opening the way to chart detailed cell lineage and fate maps in human health and disease.

We identified a breast TAM signature that is highly enriched in aggressive breast cancer subtypes and associated with shorter disease-specific survival. We also identified an auto-regulatory loop between TAMs and cancer cells driven by tumor necrosis factor alpha involving SIGLEC1 and CCL8, which is self- reinforcing through the production of CSF1.

CRPC remains dependent on AR signaling, which can act through the full-length AR (ARfl) or constitutively active splice variants, e.g. ARv7. We show here that both ARfl and ARv7 bind to the same genomic region and heterodimerize in a CRPC cell line model, but regulate distinct transcriptomes. ARv7, unlike ARfl, preferentially represses transcription and demonstrates an increased affinity for co-repressors, decreased chromatin residence time and lower dependence on FOXA1 binding. We identified a group of ARv7-repressed genes, including the UDP-galactosyltransferase B4GALT1 that are down-regulated during PCa progression and important for CRPC growth. In conclusion, we propose that ARv7 acts as a transcriptional repressor of genes that limit proliferation, a function that should be targeted in CRPC patients.

HHyPs are anatomically restricted to the ductal plate of fetal liver and maintain a unique transcriptional profile distinct from fetal hepatocytes, mature hepatocytes and mature BECs.  In addition, molecular heterogenicity within the EpCAM+ population of freshly isolated fetal and adult human liver reveals diverse gene expression signatures of hepatic and biliary lineage potential. Finally, we FACS isolated fetal HHyPs and confirmed their hybrid progenitor phenotype in vivo.

In addition, these cells could be potentially used as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Differentiation of hESCs involves selective activation or silencing of genes, a process controlled in part by the epigenetic state of the cell. In order to gain a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating differentiation of hESCs, and produce general reference epigenome maps of the human cells, we propose to establish an Epigenome Center in San Diego. Our center will be focused on both undifferentiated hESC and four hESC-derived early embryonic cell lineages including extraembryonic endoderm, trophoblast, mesendoderm (a common precursor to mesodermal and endodermal lineages), and mesenchymal cells (a specific mesoderm derivative). We have developed and validated high throughput technologies for mapping the state of DNA methylation and chromatin modifications throughout the genome, and will use these methods to generate high-resolution maps of the reference epigenomes. Specifically, we will grow and differentiate hESCs into multiple lineages, and map DNA methylation sites using a newly developed technology that combines bisulfite conversion and whole genome shotgun sequencing. We will also determine the histone modification status in the genome by performing both ChlP-chip and ChlP-Seq analysis. We will develop advanced statistical and algorithmic solutions to facilitate high-throughput sequencing data analysis, and establish an informatics pipeline for collecting, storage, and distribution of epigenome maps.

For its oncogenic function the MLL fusion protein is hijacking the the multi enzyme super elongation complex (SEC) leading to elevated expression of MLL target genes (e.g. HOXA9 and MEIS). High expression of MLL target genes is overwriting the normal hematopoietic differentiation gene expression program, resulting in undifferentiated blasts cells having a more “stem-cell like” cancer-promoting phenotype. Although extensive resources have been devoted to a better understanding of therapeutic targets for the MLL fusion to overcome the de-differentiation, the inter-dependencies of those targets for the pathophysiology of MLL is still barely understood. Here we report a comparative mode of action analysis of different inhibitors potentially interfering with MLL fusion induced differentiation blockade. We used RNA-seq for transcriptomic profiling in 14 AML and ALL cell lines treated with DMSO control or one of the 5 studied inhibitors (EPZ-5676, Brequinar, BAY-155, BAY-1251152 and OTX015). Methods: We used RNA-seq for transcriptomic profiling in 14 AML and ALL cell lines treated with DMSO control or one of the 5 studied inhibitors (EPZ-5676, Brequinar, BAY-155, BAY-1251152 and OTX015). Results: We discovered significant differences between compounds in their ability to induce differentiation and interfere with MLL target genes expression. We observed that Menin and DOT1L inhibition act very specifically on MLL fused leukemia cell lines, whereas inhibition of BET, DHODH and P-TEFb have strong effects beyond the MLL fusion . Conclusions: These results show a substantial diversity in the molecular activities of those inhibitors and provide valuable insights into the further developmental potential as single agents or in combinations in MLL fused leukemias.

RNA sequencing was used to measure gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from 47 patients with JIA prior to MTX treatment and 14 age-matched controls. Biological differences between all JIA patients and controls were explored by constructing a signature of differentially expressed genes. Unsupervised clustering and pathway analysis was performed. Transcriptional profiles were compared to a reference gene expression database representing sorted cell populations, including B and T lymphocytes, and monocytes. A signature of 99 differentially expressed genes (Bonferroni-corrected p<0.05) capturing the biological differences between all JIA patients and controls was identified. Unsupervised clustering of samples based on this list of 99 genes produced subgroups enriched for MTX response status. Comparing this gene signature to reference signatures from sorted cell populations revealed high concordance between the expression profiles of monocytes and of MTX non-responders. CXCL8 (IL-8) was the most significantly differentially expressed gene transcript comparing all JIA patients to controls (Bonferroni-corrected p=4.12E-10). Variability in clinical response to methotrexate in JIA patients is associated with differences in gene transcripts modulated in monocytes.

Although NSCs generate both cell types, they are produced sequentially as neurons are born first and glia later. In humans, this timing is extremely protracted and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Deriving glial cells such as astrocytes from human pluripotent stem cells requires 3-6 months of differentiation, greatly impeding their use in human disease modeling and regenerative medicine. Here, we report that expression of the transcription factor nuclear factor IA (NFIA) is sufficient to trigger glial competency in highly neurogenic NSCs and enables the derivation of human astrocytes within 10-12 days.  NFIA-induced astrocytes are functional and shown to promote synaptogenesis, protect neurons and generate calcium transients. The mechanism of NFIA-induced glial competency involves rapid but reversible chromatin remodeling, demethylation of the GFAP promoter and a striking effect on the cell cycle. NFIA titration and pharmacological studies indicate that acquisition of a glial-compatible G1 length is critical for achieving glial competency. Our results offer mechanistic insights into human glial competency and enable the routine use of astrocytes for studying human development and disease. Overall design: The timecourse consists of 4 timpoints.  Day 0 (d0) represents neurogenic LTNSCs, day 3 (d3) represents overexpression of NFIA with doxycycline and cells were harvested in bulk, day 6 (d6) represents cells sorted for CD44 while NFIA is overexpressed, day 9 (d9) represents CD44+ sorted cells replated in culture without the addition of doxycyline to downregulate NFIA and day 12 (d12) represents the same cultures in d9, but with 3 additional days of no doxycycline treatment.  Each timepoint has a minimum of 3 biological replicates.  Rosette cells (H9 d0) and neurons (Dapt) were profiled as controls where rosettes were one sample and neurons were performed in duplicate."

Here we report the first RNA sequencing study of these tumors, with data for 30 minimally invasive FTCs (miFTCs) and 25 FAs. We also compared 77 classical papillary thyroid carcinomas (cPTCs) and 48 follicular variant of PTCs (FVPTCs) to observe the differences in their molecular properties. Mutations in H/K/NRAS, DICER1, EIF1AX, IDH1, PTEN, SOS1, and SPOP were identified in miFTC or FA. We identified a low frequency of fusion genes in miFTC (only one, PAX8–PPARG), but a high frequency of that in PTC (17.60%). The frequencies of BRAFV600E and H/K/NRAS mutations were substantially different in miFTC and cPTC, and those of FVPTC were intermediate between miFTC and cPTC. Gene expression analysis demonstrated three molecular subtypes regardless of their histological features, including Non–BRAF–Non–RAS (NBNR), as well as BRAF–like and RAS–like. The novel molecular subtype, NBNR, was associated with DICER1, EIF1AX, IDH1, PTEN, SOS1, SPOP, and PAX8–PPARG. The transcriptome of miFTC or encapsulated FVPTC was indistinguishable from that of FA, providing a molecular explanation for the similarly indolent behavior of these tumors. We identified upregulation of genes that are related to mitochondrial biogenesis including ESRRA and PPARGC1A in oncocytic follicular thyroid neoplasm. Arm-level copy number variations were correlated to histological and molecular characteristics. These results expanded the current molecular understanding of thyroid cancer and may lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to the disease."
"human","data_sources/sra","SRP087579",56,"Adaptation of a RAS pathway activation signature from FF to FFPE tissues in colorectal cancer (FFPE RNA-Seq III)","Background: The KRAS gene is mutated in about 40% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases, which has been clinically validated as a predictive mutational marker of intrinsic resistatnce to anti-EGFR inhibitor (EGFRi) therapy. Since nearly 60% of patients with a wild type KRAS fail to respond to EGFRi treatment, there is a need to develop more reliable molecular signatures to better predict response. Here we address the challenge of adapting a gene expression signature predictive of RAS pathway activation, created using fresh frozen (FF) tissues, for use with more widely available formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Methods: In this study, we evaluated the translation of an 18-gene RAS pathway signature score from FF to FFPE in 54 CRC cases, using a head-to-head comparison of five technology platforms. FFPE-based technologies included the Affymetrix GeneChip (Affy), NanoString nCounter(NanoS), Illumina whole genome RNASeq (RNA-Acc), Illumina targeted RNASeq(t-RNA), and Illumina stranded Total RNA-rRNA-depletion (rRNA). Results: Using Affy_FF as the ""gold"" standard, initial analysis of the 18-gene RAS scores on all 54 samples shows varying pairwise Spearman correlations, with (1) Affy_FFPE(r=0.233, p=0.090); (2) NanoS_FFPE(r=0.608, p<0.0001); (3) RNA-Acc_FFPE(r=0.175, p=0.21); (4) t-RNA_FFPE (r=-0.237, p=0.085); and (5) t-RNA (r=-0.012, p=0.93). These results suggest that only NanoString has successful FF to FFPE translation. The subsequent removal of identified ""problematic"" samples (n=15) and gene (n=2) further improves the correlations of Affy_FF with three of the five technologies: Affy_FFPE (r=0.672, p<0.0001); NanoS_FFPE (r=0.738, p<0.0001); and RNA-Acc_FFPE (r=0.483, p=0.002). Conclusions: Of the five technology platforms tested, NanoString technology provides a more faithful translation of the RAS pathway gene expression signature from FF to FFPE than the Affymetrix GeneChip and multiple RNASeq technologies. Moreover, NanoString was the most forgiving technology in the analysis of samples with presumably poor RNA quality. Using this approach, the RAS signature score may now be reasonably applied to FFPE clinical samples. Overall design: Fifty-four (54) FFPE evaluable tumor specimens were selected from a larger multi-center cohort of 468 well-characterized colorectal adenocarcinoma patients whose tissues were obtained between October 2006 and September 2010 at the University of South Florida. The sample cohort was composed of tumor samples that were available as matched fresh-frozen (FF) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) pairs."

CLK2 is a member of the CLK family that phosphorylates serine- and arginine-rich (SR) proteins of the spliceosomal complex as part of a regulatory mechanism for control of pre-mRNA splicing.  SR proteins are a family of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) splicing factors involved in constitutive and alternative splicing. Monitoring specific phospho-biomarkers of CLK2 demonstrated that CC-671 inhibited phosphorylation of CLK2 substrates in cancer cells with mean IC50 of 549 nM in the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) line CAL51.  In this study, RNA sequencing approach was used to quantify the impact of CC-671 treatment on gene transcription and global alternative splicing in CAL51 cells.  Differential exon usage analysis demonstrated that CC-671 changed alternative splicing of many genes.  In addition, different sets of genes are impacted by CC-671 at both the alternative splicing and mRNA expression. Genes impacted by alternative splicing shared a set of common pathways with genes altered by mRNA expression. This result indicates that CC-671 regulates transcription via both gene expression and alternative splicing mechanisms. Overall design: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) line CAL51 was grown in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, as recommended by vendor. The growing cells were treated by CC-671 in three biological replicates at the following concentrations and time intervals.  The treatment time points were 6 hour and 24 hour. Concentration of compounds used was 3 and 10 uM. Six million cells from each treatment were harvested and RNA was isolated by RNeasy kit.

Undifferentiated hESCs as well as cells at three stages of early neural differentiation, N1 (early initiation), N2 (neural progenitor), and N3 (early glial-like) were analyzed using a combination of single read, paired-end read, and long read RNA sequencing. The results revealed enormous complexity in gene transcription and splicing dynamics during neural cell differentiation. We found previously unannotated transcripts and spliced isoforms specific for each stage of differentiation. Interestingly, splicing isoform diversity is highest in undifferentiated hESCs and decreases upon differentiation, a phenomenon we call “isoform specialization.” During neural differentiation, we observed differential expression of many types of genes including those involved in key signaling pathways, and a large number of extracellular receptors exhibit stage-specific regulation. These results provide a valuable resource for studying neural differentiation and reveal insights into the mechanisms underlying in vitro neural differentiation of hESCs, such as neural fate specification, NPC identity maintenance and the transition from a predominantly neuronal state into one with increased gliogenic potential Overall design: Characterization of changes in the transcriptome profiles during early stages of human neural differentiation from H1 !Series_overall_design=hESCs. 454 SFF files are missing. hESC_B_s9.fastq--> SRR037192 hESC_B_s8.fastq--> SRR037191 hESC_B_s7.fastq--> SRR037190 hESC_B_s6.fastq--> SRR037189 hESC_B_s5.fastq--> SRR037188 hESC_B_s4.fastq--> SRR037187 hESC_B_s3.fastq--> SRR037186 hESC_B_s2.fastq--> SRR037185 hESC_B_s16.fastq--> SRR037184 hESC_B_s15.fastq--> SRR037183 hESC_B_s14.fastq--> SRR037182 hESC_B_s13.fastq--> SRR037181 hESC_B_s12.fastq--> SRR037180 hESC_B_s11.fastq--> SRR037179 hESC_B_s10.fastq--> SRR037178 hESC_B_s1.fastq--> SRR037177 hESC_B_p6_2.fastq--> SRR037176 hESC_B_p6_1.fastq--> SRR037176 hESC_B_p5_2.fastq--> SRR037175 hESC_B_p5_1.fastq--> SRR037175 hESC_B_p4_2.fastq--> SRR037174 hESC_B_p4_1.fastq--> SRR037174 hESC_B_p3_2.fastq--> SRR037173 hESC_B_p3_1.fastq--> SRR037173 hESC_B_p2_2.fastq--> SRR037172 hESC_B_p2_1.fastq--> SRR037172 hESC_B_p1_2.fastq--> SRR037171 hESC_B_p1_1.fastq--> SRR037171 hESC_A_s3.fastq--> SRR037170 hESC_A_s2.fastq--> SRR037169 hESC_A_s1.fastq--> SRR037168 hESC_A_p3_2.fastq--> SRR037167 hESC_A_p3_1.fastq--> SRR037167 hESC_A_p2_2.fastq--> SRR037166 hESC_A_p2_1.fastq--> SRR037166 hESC_A_p1_2.fastq--> SRR037165 hESC_A_p1_1.fastq--> SRR037165 N3_A_s4.fastq--> SRR037226 N3_A_s3.fastq--> SRR037225 N3_A_s2.fastq--> SRR037224 N3_A_s1.fastq--> SRR037223 N3_A_p3_2.fastq--> SRR037222 N3_A_p3_1.fastq--> SRR037222 N3_A_p2_2.fastq--> SRR037221 N3_A_p2_1.fastq--> SRR037221 N3_A_p1_2.fastq--> SRR037220 N3_A_p1_1.fastq--> SRR037220 N2_B_s8.fastq--> SRR037219 N2_B_s7.fastq--> SRR037218 N2_B_s6.fastq--> SRR037217 N2_B_s5.fastq--> SRR037216 N2_B_s4.fastq--> SRR037215 N2_B_s3.fastq--> SRR037214 N2_B_s2.fastq--> SRR037213 N2_B_s1.fastq--> SRR037212 N2_B_p6_2.fastq--> SRR037211 N2_B_p6_1.fastq--> SRR037211 N2_B_p5_2.fastq--> SRR037210 N2_B_p5_1.fastq--> SRR037210 N2_B_p4_2.fastq--> SRR037209 N2_B_p4_1.fastq--> SRR037209 N2_B_p3_2.fastq--> SRR037208 N2_B_p3_1.fastq--> SRR037208 N2_B_p2_2.fastq--> SRR037207 N2_B_p2_1.fastq--> SRR037207 N2_B_p1_2.fastq--> SRR037206 N2_B_p1_1.fastq--> SRR037206 N2_A_s4.fastq--> SRR037205 N2_A_s3.fastq--> SRR037204 N2_A_s2.fastq--> SRR037203 N2_A_s1.fastq--> SRR037202 N2_A_p3_2.fastq--> SRR037201 N2_A_p3_1.fastq--> SRR037201 N2_A_p2_2.fastq--> SRR037200 N2_A_p2_1.fastq--> SRR037200 N2_A_p1_2.fastq--> SRR037199 N2_A_p1_1.fastq--> SRR037199 N1_A_s3.fastq--> SRR037198 N1_A_s2.fastq--> SRR037197 N1_A_s1.fastq--> SRR037196 N1_A_p3_2.fastq--> SRR037195 N1_A_p3_1.fastq--> SRR037195 N1_A_p2_2.fastq--> SRR037194 N1_A_p2_1.fastq--> SRR037194 N1_A_p1_2.fastq--> SRR037193 N1_A_p1_1.fastq--> SRR037193"

We have created immortalized cell lines from core breast biopsies of ancestry-mapped healthy women that are enriched for luminal gene expression including hormonally sensitive ERa-FOXA1-GATA3 transcription factor network. Gene expression pattern followed by intrinsic subtype classification identified these cell lines as “normal” counterpart to luminal A, basal, and normal-like subtypes of breast cancers.

The primary tool used by the Global Program to Eliminate LF is mass drug administration (MDA), and some 500 million people take the medications each year. Mild to moderate adverse events (AEs) are common after LF treatment, and these pose a challenge for the LF elimination program. To better understand the pathogenesis of AEs, we studied patients from a LF treatment trial in Côte d'Ivoire. Method: Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes collected before and 24h after treatment (when AEs peak). Global RNA sequencing was performed for 9 individuals with systemic moderate AEs and for 9 matched controls without AEs. Differential gene expression analysis (DESeq) identified transcriptional signatures (TS) associated with post-treatment AEs. Results: Out of the 36 sequenced samples, the 9 post-treatment samples from subjects with AEs had a distinct TS (P=0.006 by clustering analysis); 744 genes were significantly upregulated in this group (post vs pre-treatment, paired). These genes were enriched for many biological pathways that included pro-inflammatory pathways such as TLR and NF-kappa B signaling. Genes upregulated in AEs were also significantly enriched for having STAT1/2/3 transcription factor binding sites indicating the importance for interferons in the AEs pathogenesis.

Here, we used mass-spectrometry to identify a dense network of proteins physically interacting with METTL3, a core component of the methyltransferase complex, and show that two of them, WTAP and KIAA1429, are required for methylation.  Combining high resolution m6A-Seq with knockdown of WTAP allowed us to define accurate maps, at near single-nucleotide resolution, of sites of mRNA methylation across four dynamic programs in human and mouse, including development, differentiation, reprogramming and immune response. Internal WTAP-dependent methylation sites were largely static across the different surveyed conditions and present in the majority of mRNAs. However, methylations were found at much lower levels within highly expressed mRNAs, and methylation is inversely correlated with mRNA stability, consistent with a role in establishing an overall basal, cell-type invariant, distribution of degradation rates. In addition, we identify thousands of WTAP-independent methylation sites at transcription initiation sites, forming part of the mRNA cap structure. We show that the methylations occur at the first transcribed nucleotide, and find that thousands of transcripts are present in different isoforms differing in the methylation state of the first transcribed nucleotide, a previously unappreciated complexity of the transcriptome.

Here,  we use genome editing to delete the entire risk on non-risk haplotype from the genomes of human iPSCs and perform genomewide transcriptional profiling along the timecourse of their differentiation into vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). These studies identify a network of ~3000 genes governed by the risk haplotype in VSMCs that predict deficits in cell division, adhesion and contraction, which we confirmufunctionally. Remarkably, deleting the risk haplotype reverts VSMCs to resemble the non-risk VSMCs, suggesting that the risk region drives a cell state transition.  transcriptionally and functionally. . Deleting the risk haplotype reverts these cells to reverted to the non-risk of iPSCs we show that the non-risk haplotype has little effect on locus we produce iPSCs from risk and non-risk individuals, delete each haplotype using genome editing and generate vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We show that risk VSMCs exhibit aberrant adhesion and contraction, concomitant with dramatically altered global transcriptional changes that are enriched in previously identified cardiovascular disease genes and pathways. Unexpectedly, deleting the risk haplotype rescues VSMC transcriptional identity and function, while expressing the 9p21.3-associated long non-coding RNA ANRIL induces risk phenotypes in non-risk VSMCs. This studies shows that the risk haplotype dominantly predisposes VSMCs to adopt perturbed phenotypes associated with cardiovascular disease and establishes haplotype-edited iPSCs as powerful tools for functionally annotating human-specific variation in non-coding genomic regions.

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP066197",160,"Transcriptional profiling of TH2 cells identifies pathogenic features associated with asthma","Allergic asthma and rhinitis are two common chronic allergic diseases that affect the lungs and nose, respectively. Both diseases share clinical and pathological features characteristic of excessive allergen-induced type 2 inflammation, orchestrated by memory CD4+ T cells that produce type 2 cytokines (TH2 cells). However, a large majority of subjects with allergic rhinitis do not develop asthma, suggesting divergence in disease mechanisms. Since TH2 cells play a pathogenic role in both these diseases and are also present in healthy non-allergic subjects, we performed global transcriptional profiling to determine whether there are qualitative differences in TH2 cells from subjects with allergic asthma, rhinitis and healthy controls. TH2 cells from asthmatic subjects expressed higher levels of several genes that promote their survival as well as alter their metabolic pathways to favor persistence at sites of allergic inflammation. In addition, genes that enhanced TH2 polarization and TH2 cytokine production were also upregulated in asthma. Several genes that oppose T cell activation were downregulated in asthma, suggesting enhanced activation potential of TH2 cells from asthmatic subjects. Many novel genes with poorly defined functions were also differentially expressed in asthma. Thus, our transcriptomic analysis of circulating TH2 cells has identified several molecules that are likely to confer pathogenic features to TH2 cells that are either unique or common to both asthma and rhinitis. Overall design: RNA-sequencing of circulating TH2 cells isolated from a cohort of patients with allergic rhinitis (25), asthma (40) patients and healthy non allergic subjects (15). Cells were directly isolated from blood by flow cytometry. Total RNA was extracted, messenger RNA was selected and cDNA was amplified linearly with a PCR based method (Picelli et al. 2014).

This retrospective Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium study evaluated molecular aberrations in primary cancers associated with locoregional recurrence (LRR) or distant metastasis (DM) compared to non-recurrent controls.  We identified 115 HER2 negative, therapy naïve, T 1-3 and N 0-1 BC patients treated with mastectomy but no post-mastectomy radiotherapy.  This included 32 LRR, 34 DM and 49 controls. RNAseq was performed on primary tumors in 110 patients; with no difference in RNA profiles between patients with LRR, DM or controls.  DNA analysis on 57 primary tumors (17 LRR, 15 DM and 25 controls) identified significantly more NF1 mutations and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway gene mutations in patients with LRR (24%, 47%) and DM (27%, 40%) compared to controls (0%, 0%; p<0.0001 and p=0.0070, respectively).  Three patients had matched primary vs LRR samples, one patient had a gain of a NF1 mutation in the LRR.  There was no significant difference between the groups for PTEN loss or cleaved caspase 3 expression.  The mean percentage Ki 67 labeling index was higher in patients with LRR (29.2%) and DM (26%) versus controls (14%,p= 0.0045).  In summary, mutations in the MAPK pathway, specifically NF1, were associated with both LRR and DM, suggesting that alterations in MAPK signaling are associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype.  Validation of these associations in tissues from randomized trials may support targeted therapy to reduce breast cancer recurrence. Overall design: This is a multicenter retrospective study of patients who underwent mastectomy at a participating Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium (TBCRC) institution.  Study centers included Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, University of Pittsburgh, Duke University, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Georgetown University, University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Vanderbilt University, University of Alabama at Birmingham and MD Anderson Cancer Center.  Eligible patients included those patients who underwent mastectomy without radiation for T stage 1-3 and N stage 0-1 breast cancer, and for whom archived tissues and outcome data were available. Patients with any recurrence, loco-regional (LRR) or with distant metastasis (DM), were treated from 1997 to present time as this was felt to represent an era when treatment recommendations would be the most uniform and consistent. Patients with LRR could have a subsequent DM as long as this DM was diagnosed at least 3 months after the LRR. Patients who developed LRR after developing distant metastases were placed in the DM group. Control patients were treated from 1997 to 2007 to allow at least five years follow-up with a disease-free interval.  Controls were matched to cases for age, ER/PR status, chemotherapy and endocrine therapy regimens and year of diagnosis.  All patients were treated with an upfront mastectomy followed by systemic therapy if indicated, which included chemotherapy, endocrine therapy or both.  Patients were ineligible if they received post-mastectomy radiation therapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, had a T4 primary tumor, N2 nodal disease, were HER2 positive, had positive margins after mastectomy, had fewer than 10 lymph nodes retrieved at axillary lymph node dissection, or had inadequate follow-up (<5 years) if a control patient.

However, resistance to these targeted therapies invariably develops and limits their clinical efficacy. Targeting tumours with kinase inhibitors induces complex adaptive survival programs that promote the persistence of a fraction of the original cancer cell population, facilitating the eventual outgrowth of inhibitor-resistant tumour clones following clonal evolution. Here we show that the addition of a newly identified transcriptional repressor, THZ1, to targeted cancer therapy enhances cell killing and impedes the emergence of drug-resistant cell populations in cellular and in vivo cancer models with diverse genetic dependencies. We propose that targeted therapy induces a state of transcriptional dependency in a subpopulation of cells poised to become drug tolerant. THZ1 can exploit this dependency by blocking dynamic transcriptional responses, remodelling of enhancers and key signalling outputs required for tumour cell survival in the setting of targeted cancer therapies. These findings suggest that the addition of THZ1 to targeted cancer therapies is a promising broad-based strategy to hinder the emergence of drug-resistant cancer cell populations.

Although these screens affect thousands of gene products, the typical readout is based on low-complexity rather than genome-wide assays. To address this limitation, we introduce Pooled Library Amplification for Transcriptome Expression (PLATE-Seq), a low-cost, genome-wide mRNA profiling methodology specifically designed to complement high-throughput screening (HTS) assays. Introduction of sample-specific barcodes during reverse transcription supports pooled library construction and low-depth sequencing that is 10 to 20-fold less expensive than conventional RNA-Seq. The use of network-based algorithms to infer protein activity from PLATE-Seq data results in comparable reproducibility to 30M read sequencing. Indeed, PLATE-Seq reproducibility compares favorably to other large-scale perturbational profiling studies such as the Connectivity Map (CMap) and Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS). Overall design: We use automated liquid-handling to introduce lysis buffer, capture polyadenylated mRNA with an oligo(dT)-grafted plate, and deliver well-specific, barcoded oligo(dT) primers to every sample in a multi-well plate (Figure 1A). After reverse transcription, the cDNA in each well contains a specific barcode sequence on its 5'-end and a common adapter, such that all samples can be combined into a single pool for purification and concentration. We then use Klenow Large Fragment for pooled second-strand synthesis from adapter-linked random primers. Because this polymerase lacks strand-displacement and 5'-to-3' exonuclease activities, each cDNA molecule produces at most, one second-strand synthesis product containing the sample barcode (Figure 1B). Finally, the pooled library is enriched in a single PCR prior to sequencing. The resulting libraries represent the 3'-ends of mRNAs and are sequenced to a depth of 0.5-2 million raw reads per sample."

HMGA1 expression suppresses the abnormal basal cell differentiation to squamous, inflammatory and epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype commonly observed in association with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Results: HMGA1 knockdown experiments indicate that when HMGA1 expression is suppressed, the airway basal cells cannot normally differentiate into a mucociliary epithelium, form an intact barrier, and repair following injury. Instead, airway basal cell differentiation was skewed to an abnormal squamous EMT-like phenotype associated with airway remodeling in COPD. This study demonstrates that HMGA1 plays a key role in normal airway differentiation, regeneration of the normal airway epithelium following injury, and suppression of expression of genes related to squamous metaplasia, EMT and inflammation.

Human cancer genome sequencing studies have identified frequent MLL3 point mutations, however, the question of how these mutations alter MLL3 function and contribute to oncogenesis remains unanswered. Here, we have characterized a cancer mutational hot spot in the MLL3 Plant Homeo Domain (PHD) repeats that correlates with poor patient survival. Cancer-associated mutations in the MLL3-PHD disrupt interaction with the BAP1 deubiquitinase complex. BAP1 loss-of-function in cancer cells significantly reduces MLL3 recruitment to enhancers regions, resulting in reduced H3K4me1 and increased H3K27me3 levels at these loci. Notably, we find that increased H3K27me3 levels in BAP1 null cells are due to decreased MLL3/UTX/COMPASS occupancy. Reducing H3K27me3 through PRC2 catalytic inhibition resets the pattern of gene expression in cells with defective MLL3- BAP1-UTX activity and impairs tumor proliferation in cancer cells with MLL3 mutations. This study provides a molecular mechanism to explain the role of MLL3 PHD mutations in cancer pathogenesis. Therefore, based on these observations, we propose a potential therapeutic strategy for cancers harboring MLL3/COMPASS mutations by resetting the Polycomb/COMPASS epigenetic balanced state of gene expression.

Midline high-grade gliomas (HGGs) are deadly brain tumors characterized by lysine-to-methionine substitutions at position 27 in histone 3 (H3) variants (denoted H3K27M), which are core components of the nucleosome. H3K27M, the first event in midline HGG development, results in a drastic loss of the repressive histone mark H3K27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3), and a notable increase in H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac), a mark associated with active chromatin and cellular identity. H3K27ac gain was suggested to promote tumorigenesis in H3K27M-HGGs, but how these opposing marks shape oncogenesis remains controversial. We therefore characterized the active regulatory chromatin states in H3.3K27M and H3K27 wild-type HGGs and in H3.3K27M CRISPR/Cas9 knockout tumor-derived cell lines, as an isogenic tumor model of the mutation. We show that H3.3K27M-HGGs have distinct promoter, enhancer, super-enhancer, and core transcription factor circuitries from wild-type HGGs. However, while removal of H3.3K27M restores gross H3K27ac levels to those of wild-type HGGs, we observe minimal disruption of H3K27ac deposition at these active transcriptional elements, suggesting that they are a function of the cell of origin and independent of direct H3K27M mutagenesis and active regulation. Using quantitative ChIP-seq, we show that in H3.3K27M-HGGs, H3K27ac is pervasively deposited across the genome, including at normally silent repeat elements, leading to their increased baseline expression. H3.3K27M cells respond to DNA demethylating agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors, which further increase repeat element expression, including that of specific endogenous retroviral (ERVs) families. Our findings decouple cell lineage programs from H3K27M-dependent pervasive deposition of H3K27 acetylation. De-repression of ERVs may enhance the triggering of innate immune pathways, representing a therapeutic vulnerability in H3.3K27M HGGs.

ADT failure results in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), that inevitably leads to metastasis. We hypothesized that differences in tumor transcriptional programs may reflect differential responses to ADT and subsequent metastasis.   Results: We performed whole transcriptome analysis of 20 patient-matched Pre-ADT biopsies and 20 Post-ADT prostatectomy specimens, and identified two subgroups of patients (high impact and low impact groups) that exhibited distinct transcriptional changes in response to ADT. We found that all patients lost AR-dependent subtype (PCS2) transcriptional signatures. The high impact group maintained the more aggressive subtype (PCS1) signal, while the low impact group more resembled an AR-suppressed (PCS3) subtype. Computational analyses identified transcription factor coordinated groups (TFCGs) enriched in the high impact group network. Leveraging a large public dataset of over 800 metastatic and primary samples, we identified 33 TFCGs in common between high impact group and metastatic lesions, including SOX4/FOXA2/GATA4, ERF/ETV5/ETV3/ELF4, and a TFCG containing JUN, JUNB, JUND, FOS, FOSB, and FOSL1. The majority of metastatic TFCGs were subsets of larger TFCGs in the high impact group network, suggesting refinement of critical TFCGs in prostate cancer progression.   Conclusions: We have identified TFCGs associated with pronounced initial transcriptional response to ADT, aggressive signatures, and metastasis. Our findings suggest multiple new hypotheses that could lead to novel combination therapies to prevent development of CRPC following ADT.

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP055390",52,"Transcriptome analysis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)","Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a biologically and clinically heterogeneous disease. The somatic hypermutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) genes has been identified as one of the most robust prognostic markers in CLL. Patients with unmutated IGHV status (U-CLL) typically experience an inferior outcome compared to those whose clones express mutated IGHV genes (M-CLL). We conducted a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in CD19+ B-cells from a group of 43 CLL patients using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). Using base-pair resolution methylation sequencing, 2323 differentially methylated regions between CLL and normal B-cells (CLL-specific DMRs) and 569 between M-CLL and U-CLL samples (IGHV-specific DMRs) were identified in the CLL genomes. The IGHV-specific DMRs are mostly unique when compared to the CLL-specific DMRs. Less than 10% of the IGHV-specific DMRs are located in promoter regions; however, more than half of these overlap with known DNase I hypersensitive sites, enhancer regions marked by histone modification (H3K4Me1 and H3K27Ac), and transcription factor binding sites in the ENCODE datasets, which indicates that these DMRs contain regulatory sequences. Distinctive DNA methylation patterns were observed in M-CLL and U-CLL samples. Overall, U-CLL was found to contain 50% more hypermethylated regions than M-CLL samples. The hypermethylated loci observed in the U-CLL samples also appear to be hypermethylated in normal naïve B-cells as compared memory B-cells, suggesting that M-CLL and U-CLL differ in differentiation status corresponding to normal B-cell differentiation stages. RNA-seq analysis performed using matched samples (n=34), in which both DNA methylation and gene expression data were available, demonstrated excellent correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression. Several genes whose expression status was previously shown to be associated with CLL prognosis such as ZAP70, CRY1, LDOC1, SEPT10, LAG3, and LPL were differentially methylated in the promoter regions between M-CLL and U-CLL samples indicating that DNA methylation plays an important role in defining the gene expression patterns of these prognostic genes. We further validated 9 genes with IGHV-specific DMRs in the promoter regions using bisulfite pyrosequencing, and the results demonstrated excellent correlation between differential methylation and IGHV mutation status. These novel differentially methylated genes could be developed into biomarkers for CLL prognosis. In addition, DNA hypomethylation was observed in a significant number of genes involved in lymphocyte activation such as PDCD1, NFAT1, and CD5. DNA hypomethylation was observed in the proximal promoter and far up-stream enhancer regions of CD5, an important cell surface marker that uniquely identifies CLL. Overall, the DNA methylation landscape in CLL patients indicates that CLL B cells possess an active B-cell phenotype; at the same time, U-CLL and M-CLL are faithfully committed to their lineage resembling either naïve or memory B-cells.  In summary, this comprehensive DNA methylation analysis has identified a large number of novel epigenetic changes in CLL patients. The results from this study will further advance our understanding of the epigenetic contribution to molecular subtypes in CLL. Overall design: To perform a transcriptome analysis in CLL, we generated sequencing libraries from total RNA isolated from purified B-cells of CLL patients and healthy donnors. The RNA-seq libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer with a read length of 100bp.  11 CLL B-cell samples, 3 normal control samples including one each of normal CD19+ B cells were studied. We generated 20-30 million Illumina sequencing reads for each sample."

The uptake of modified LDL by macrophages leading to foam cell formation is critical to the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. The gene expression programs driving foam cell formation as well as their genetic determinants have not been characterized on the genome-wide level to date. Here, we differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from 70 healthy individuals into macrophages, followed by stimulation of iPSC-derived macrophages with acetylated LDL (acLDL). Using strand-specific RNA-sequencing, we identified 1,726 differentially expressed genes between resting and acLDL-treated macrophages, mapping to pro-inflammatory signaling and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways. We found the expression and splicing of 1,817 and 1,276 genes to be modulated by local genetic variants under acLDL stimulation, respectively. In addition, we defined 66 response-specific expression quantitative trait loci (QTLs), including the FCER1A and FADS2 gene regions, which have previously been associated with the regulation of inflammatory biomarkers and major lipids, respectively. Further, we identified 39 response-specific splicing QTLs, including the ANKRD9, FCGR2A and SIRPA gene regions. In summary, we have developed an experimental framework to map genotype-dependent gene expression and splicing changes in iPSC-derived macrophages dependent on acLDL exposure, many of which underlie genetic risk regions of cardiovascular disease and related traits."

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP169609",95,"Selective roles of vertebrate PCF11 in premature and full-length transcript termination (chromatin-bound RNA-seq)","The pervasive nature of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription requires efficient termination. A key player in this process is the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) factor PCF11, which directly binds to the Pol II C-terminal domain and dismantles elongating Pol II from DNA in vitro. We demonstrate that PCF11-mediated termination is essential for vertebrate development. A range of genomic analyses, including: mNET-seq, 3' mRNA-seq, chromatin RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, reveals that PCF11 enhances transcription termination and stimulates early polyadenylation genome-wide. PCF11 binds preferentially between closely spaced genes, where it prevents transcriptional interference and downstream gene silencing. Notably, PCF11 is sub-stoichiometric to the CPA complex. Low levels of PCF11 are maintained by an auto-regulatory mechanism involving premature termination of its own transcript, and are important for normal development. Both in human cell culture and during zebrafish development, PCF11 selectively attenuates the expression of other transcriptional regulators by premature CPA and termination. Overall design: Semi-nascent transcriptome measured by chromatin-bound RNA-seq in HeLa cells.

For example, bone marrow-derived MSCs from old individuals are known to have reduced ability to produce bone and cartilage cells, while biased towards making adipose tissues, hence aged bone marrow are referred to as ""yellow marrow"". Here we report, using step-wise treatment with different ""cocktails"" of small molecules, we turned old skin fibroblasts into much younger MSC-like cells (MSC-LCs), which reversed many aging features including shortened telomere as well as reduced proliferation potentials and differentiation bias. Moreover, MSC-LCs manifest potent effects in bone and cartilage repair in vivo. MSC-LCs also demonstrated strong immune modulatory functions both in vitro and in vivo during liver damage repair.

So far no in vivo model exists for long-term KSHV persistence in B cells and associated lymphomagenesis. Here we report that double-infection of KSHV and EBV of mice with reconstituted human immune system components (huNSG mice) leads to KSHV persistence and increased B cell lymphomagenesis. Double-infected tumor cell lines can be rescued from these animals and display plasma cell differentiation similar to PELs. KSHV transactivates lytic EBV replication during double infection and this is required for increased tumorigenesis in double-infected animals. This elevated lytic EBV replication was also found in KSHV and EBV double-infected B cell lymphomas of patients. Thus, KSHV infection persists due to EBV transformation and may transactivate lytic EBV replication for increased horizontal spread of dual infected B cells. Thus, PEL like Kaposi sarcoma could be targeted by inhibition of lytic herpesvirus infection."

We show that a fraction of MTHFD1 resides in the nucleus, where it is recruited to distinct genomic loci by direct interaction with BRD4. Inhibition of either BRD4 or MTHFD1 results in similar changes in nuclear metabolite composition and gene expression, and pharmacologic inhibitors of the two pathways synergize to impair cancer cell viability in vitro and in vivo. Our finding that MTHFD1 and other metabolic enzymes are chromatin-associated suggests a direct role for nuclear metabolism in the control of gene expression.

Objectives: Since airway basal cell (BC) stem/progenitor cells exhibit the earliest abnormalities associated with smoking (hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia), we hypothesized that smoker BC have a dysregulated transcriptome linked, in part, to known GWAS/candidate gene loci. Methods: Massive parallel RNA sequencing was used to compare the transcriptome of BC purified from the airway epithelium of healthy nonsmokers (n=10) and smokers (n=7). The chromosomal location of the differentially expressed genes was compared to loci identified by GWAS and candidate gene studies to confer risk for COPD. Measurements and Main Results: Smoker BC have 676 known genes differentially expressed compared to nonsmoker BC, dominated by smoking up-regulation. Strikingly, 166 (25%) of these genes are located on chromosome 19, with 13 localized to 19q13.2 (p<10-4 compared to chance), including TGFB1, LTBP4, EGLN2 and NFKBIB, genes associated with risk for COPD. Conclusions: These observations provide the first direct link of known genetic risks for smoking-related lung disease with the specific population of lung cells that undergoes the earliest changes associated with smoking. Overall design: The human airway basal cell transcriptome of 7 smokers versus 10 nonsmokers was compared using massive parallel RNA sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 2000)."

In order to characterize the factors associated with heterogeneity in response to ibuprofen, we performed functional neuroimaging, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assessments, biochemical assays, and gene expression analysis in twenty-nine healthy subjects who underwent third molar extraction. Subjects were treated with rapid-acting ibuprofen (400 mg; N=19) or placebo (N=10) in a randomized, double-blind design.  Compared to placebo, ibuprofen-treated subjects exhibited greater reduction in pain scores, alterations in CBF in brain regions associated with pain processing, and inhibition of ex vivo COX-1 and COX-2 activity and urinary prostaglandin metabolites (p<0.05). Ibuprofen-treated subjects could be stratified into partial responders (N=9, required rescue medication) and complete responders (N=10, no rescue medication). This variability in analgesic efficacy was not associated with demographic/clinical characteristics, markers of systemic inflammation, or ibuprofen pharmacokinetics. Complete responders exhibited less suppression of urinary prostaglandin metabolites and greater induction of serum tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin 8, compared to partial responders (p<0.05).  Partial responders exhibited more alterations in gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after surgery, with an enrichment in inflammatory pathways.  These findings suggest that activation of the prostanoid biosynthetic pathway and regulation of the inflammatory response to surgery differs between partial and complete responders.  Future studies are necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this variability and identify biomarkers that are predictive of ibuprofen response. Overall design: Human subjects were given Ibuprofen (400 mg; n=19) or placebo (n=10) following surgical extraction of their third molars. Subjects given Ibuprofen were retrospectively classified as partial responders (n=9) if they required rescue medication (hydrocodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg), or full responders (n=10) if they did not. All subjects in the placebo group received rescue medication.  Blood was collected from subjects before surgery (baseline) and at two time points following surgery (post-surgery 1, post-surgery 2). Both post-surgery samples were collected after subjects were given drug/placebo.

To understand how genetic variation and natural selection contribute to these differences, we tested for the effects of African versus European ancestry on the transcriptional response of primary macrophages to live bacterial pathogens. 12% of macrophage-expressed genes show ancestry-associated differences in the gene regulatory response to infection, and African ancestry specifically predicts a stronger inflammatory response and reduced intracellular bacterial growth. A large proportion of these differences are under genetic control: for 569 genes, more than 75% of ancestry effects on the immune response can be explained by a single cis- or trans-acting eQTL. Finally, we show that genetic effects on the immune response are strongly enriched for recent, population-specific signatures of adaptation.

In this study we demonstrate that WNT signalling drives a distinct form of non-directional cell motility that requires a key centrosome module, but not microtubules or centrosomes.  Upon exosome mobilization of Planar Cell Polarity proteins, we show that DVL2 orchestrates recruitment of a CEP192-PLK4/AURKB complex to the cell cortex where PLK4/AURKB act redundantly to drive protrusive activity and cell motility. This is mediated by coordination of formin-dependent actin remodelling through displacement of cortically localized DAAM1 for DAAM2.  Furthermore, abnormal expression of PLK4, AURKB and DAAM1 is associated with poor outcomes in breast and bladder cancers.  Thus, a centrosomal module plays an atypical function in WNT signalling and actin nucleation that is critical for cancer cell motility and is associated with more aggressive cancers.  These studies have broad implications in how contextual signalling controls distinct modes of cell migration.

We have performed a comprehensive analysis to determine the impact of these commonly mutated splicing factors on pre-mRNA splicing in the stem/progenitor cells and in the erythroid and myeloid precursors in splicing factor mutant MDS. Using RNA-seq, we determined the aberrantly spliced genes and dysregulated pathways in bone marrow CD34+ cells of a large group of 82 MDS patients. Splicing factor mutations in MDS result in different mechanistic alterations in splicing and largely affect different genes, but these converged in common dysregulated pathways and cellular processes, including RNA splicing, translation and mitochondrial dysfunction, indicating that these mutations operate through common mechanisms in MDS. Many of these dysregulated pathways and cellular processes can be linked to the known disease pathophysiology and to the phenotypes associated with splicing factor mutations in MDS, whilst several others have not been previously associated with MDS, such as sirtuin signalling. Overall design: RNA-sequencing was performed on bone marrow CD34+ hematopoeitic stem and progenitor cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and healthy controls to identify differential splicing between samples with mutations in the splicing factor SF3B1, SRSF2 or U2AF1 comparative to samples from myelodysplactic syndrome patients without mutations in these splicing factors and healthy controls.

We sequenced 295 cells and compared their profiles to unsorted cells isolated from primary human fetal cortex, primary human adult cortex, and hCS. Clustering of all cells using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) approach revealed a distinct populations of SOX10+ oligodendrocytes, within which the O4+ cells derived from hOLS clustered most closely to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and mature oligodendrocytes from the primary human adult cortical tissue. Additionally, subpopulations of OPCs, newly formed oligodendrocytes, and myelinating oligodendrocytes derived were observed in the hOLS-derived cluster. To further assess the state of oligodendrocyte-lineage cells in hOLS, we performed a Monocle analysis which revealed a spectrum of oligodendrocyte-lineage stages in hOLS ranging from dividing cells that closely resembled primary OPCs to mature cells that closely resembled primary oligodendrocytes.

Recently, long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) were reported to play important roles in mental diseases. However, little was known about their molecular mechanism in pathogenesis of SZ and BD. Here, we performed RNA sequencing on 82 post-mortem brain tissues from three brain regions (orbitofrontal cortex (BA11), anterior cingulate cortex (BA24) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9)) of patients with SZ and BD and control subjects, generating over one billion reads. We characterized lincRNA transcriptome in the three brain regions and identified 20 differentially expressed lincRNAs (DELincRNAs) in BA11 for BD, 34 and 1 in BA24 and BA9 for SZ, respectively. Our results showed that these DELincRNAs exhibited brain region-specific patterns. Applying weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we revealed that DELincRNAs together with other genes can function as modules to perform different functions in different brain regions, such as immune system development in BA24 and oligodendrocyte differentiation in BA9. Additionally, we found that DNA methylation alteration could partly explain the dysregulation of lincRNAs, some of which could function as enhancers in the pathogenesis of major psychosis. Together, we performed systematical characterization of dysfunctional lincRNAs in multiple brain regions of major psychosis, which provided a valuable resource to understand their roles in SZ and BD pathology and helped to discover novel biomarkers. Overall design: RNA sequencing of 82 brain samples including each of 19 from BA9 and BA24 and 44 from BA11. We performed RNA sequencing on three brain regions namely the BA11 (part of orbitofrontal cortex), BA24 (part of anterior cingulate) and BA9 (part of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) from SZ and BD patients and psychiatrically normal individuals.In summary, there were 44 BA11 samples from 16 SZ, 16 BD and 12 control subjects, and 19 BA24 and 19 BA9 samples from the same subjects including 6 SZ, 7 BD and 6 controls."

In an effort to explore alternative modes of Myc perturbation, we identified KI-MS2-008 as a small molecule that binds Max and modulates Myc-driven transcription, and in some cellular contexts, KI-MS2-008 treatment leads to a decrease in c-Myc protein levels. As the Myc/Max heterodimer controls many cellular processes, we expected that treatment with this small molecule would cause changes in the transcriptome. We found that treatment with 10 µM KI-MS2-008 resulted in global alterations in the transcriptome, mimicking direct Myc inactivation with doxycycline in P493-6, a B cell line with a Tet-Off system for c-Myc expression. We also discovered enrichment of various Myc target gene sets in the genes downregulated in response to KI-MS2-008 treatment in P493-6 cells. This trend was also observed in ST486 cells, but not in P3HR1 cells, which were chosen as non-engineered B cell lines that were sensitive and insensitive, respectively, toward KI-MS2-008 in cell viability assays.

In this study, we find that two transcription factors, MYCN and SOX17, enable the indefinite propagation of human endothelial arterial precursors in vitro (“expandable arterial endothelial precursors,” eAEPs). Independent eAEP lines differ in their proclivity to undergo an endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), a hallmark event in a broad array of vascular diseases and disorders. Some lines spontaneously become mesenchymal over time in culture, an effect exacerbated by inhibition of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor, while others do not readily convert. These distinctions were exploited to identify genes that correlate with resistance to an EndoMT and to elucidate transcriptional changes that underpin the transition. We believe the eAEPs may be useful not only as tractable tools for biological or pathological studies, but also as platforms for drug discovery.

We identified an efficient OCT4-targeting guide RNA using an inducible human embryonic stem cell-based system and microinjection of mouse zygotes. Using these refined methods, we efficiently and specifically targeted the gene encoding OCT4 (POU5F1) in diploid human zygotes and found that blastocyst development was compromised. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that, in POU5F1-null cells, gene expression was downregulated not only for extra-embryonic trophectoderm genes, such as CDX2, but also for regulators of the pluripotent epiblast, including NANOG. By contrast, Pou5f1-null mouse embryos maintained the expression of orthologous genes, and blastocys  t development was established, but maintenance was compromised.

Signals that drive long-term reshaping of cell phenotypes are difficult to resolve because of complex feedback networks that operate over extended times. It is clear PIP3-dependent modulation of mRNA accumulation is important in this process but is poorly understood. We have quantified the genome-wide mRNA-landscape of non-transformed, breast epithelium-derived MCF10a cells and its response to transient (EGF or PI3Ka-selective inhibitor) or chronic (isogenic cells expressing an oncomutant PI3Ka allele or lacking the PIP3-phosphatase /tumour-suppressor, PTEN) perturbations of PIP3.These results show that whilst many mRNAs are changed by long-term  genetic perturbation of PIP3 signaling (“butterfly effect”), a much smaller number change with a directional logic that aligns with different PIP3 perturbations, allowing discrimination of more directly regulated mRNAs. Our results also indicate that mRNAs can be differentially sensitive to specific features of PIP3 signals, that PIP3-sensitive mRNAs encode PI3K pathway components and identify the transcription factor binding motifs SRF and PRDM1 as important regulators of PIP3-sensitive mRNAs involved in cell movement.

Previously, we identified that Pol II-associated factor 1 (PAF1) modulates the release of paused Pol II into productive elongation. Here, we find that PAF1 occupies transcriptional enhancers and restrains hyperactivation of a subset of these enhancers. Enhancer activation as the result of Paf1 loss releases Pol II from paused promoters of nearby PAF1 target genes. Knockout of PAF1-regulated enhancers attenuates the release of paused Pol II on PAF1 target genes without major interference in the establishment of pausing at their cognate promoters. Thus, a subset of enhancers can primarily modulate gene expression by controlling the release of paused Pol II in a PAF1-dependent manner.

To establish the reproducibility of a well-defined long term neuronal differentiation protocol, we repeated the cellular and molecular comparison of the same two iPSC lines across five distinct laboratories. Despite uncovering acceptable variability within individual laboratories, we detect poor cross-site reproducibility of the differential gene expression signature between these two lines. Factor analysis identifies the laboratory as the largest source of variation along with several variation-inflating confounds such as passaging effects and progenitor storage. Single cell transcriptomics shows substantial cellular heterogeneity underlying inter-laboratory variability and being responsible for biases in differential gene expression inference. Factor analysis-based normalization of the combined dataset can remove the nuisance technical effects, enabling the execution of robust hypothesis generating studies. Our study shows that multi-center collaborations can expose systematic biases and identify critical factors to be standardized when publishing novel protocols, contributing to increased cross-site reproducibility.

"human","data_sources/sra","ERP008967",107,"Mapping_embryonic_stem_cell_surface_interactions_to_transcriptional_phenotypes","The activation of receptors displayed on the surface of cells typically initiates cytoplasmic signalling cascades that lead to changes in cellular transcriptional responses so that a cell expresses proteins that enable it to behave appropriately as a function of their position within an organism. Understanding these signals and learning how to either prevent or ectopically activate them could have many therapeutic benefits and applications. In some cases these signals are highly localised, being delivered by directly neighbouring cells that express ligands which specifically bind to and activate receptors; for example, stem cells display receptors for ligands provided by cells within their niche to both ensure continual production of cells, and that their cellular progeny are directed towards appropriate fates. While for some cell types we know something of these signals enabling the in vitro differentiation of stem cells towards certain cellular fates, the differentiation processes is often not complete and so “immature” cell types which are not fully functional are produced, implying that some important signals are missing. Here, we propose to systematically identify receptor-triggered signalling pathways by stimulating receptors on the surface of human stem cells by using a library of soluble recombinant oligomerised protein ligands and measuring the consequent transcriptional perturbations using RNA-seq. We propose to screen an existing library of ~50 oligomerised human ligands previously used in receptor protein interaction screens and first test them for their ability to bind to human stem cells to identify those ligands for which the stem cells express a cell surface receptor. For those ligands which interact with the stem cells (we estimate between 2 and 5), they will be added to stem cell cultures and their effects on transcription quantified. The budget requested is sufficient for us to include controls and test important parameters such different time points after addition of the proteins."

Such methods can cause loss of coverage at the 5’ end of genes, impacting the ability to detect fusions when used on degraded samples. The goal of this study was to quantify the effects RNA degradation has on fusion detection when using poly-A selected mRNA and to identify the variables involved in this process Methods: Total RNA was extracted from solid tumor tissue and whole blood using the Qiagen® miRNeasy Micro and Mini kits, respectively. The KU812 cell line was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and UHR (Universal Human Reference RNA) was purchased from Agilent (Santa Clara, CA). UHR is a mixture of cell lines derived from breast adenocarcinoma, hepatoblastoma, cervix adenocarcinoma, testis embryonal carcinoma, gliobastoma, melanoma, liposarcoma, histiocytic lymphoma, lymphoblastic leukemia and plasmocytoma. For Degradation experiments, two micrograms of human universal reference RNA (UHR) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and 1ug of RNA extracted from KU812 cell line (purchased from ATCC) were degraded at 74oC from 1 to 11 minutes in 1 minute intervals, using the NEBNext® Magnesium RNA Fragmentation Module Kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA). RNA was then purified and concentrated with RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Results: In this study, we designed experiments using artificially degraded RNA from cell lines as well as naturally degraded RNA from tissue samples to quantify the effect RNA degradation has on fusion detection when using poly-A selected RNA libraries We found that both the RNA degradation level and the distance from the 3’ end of a gene, negatively impact the read coverage profile in RNA-seq. Furthermore, the median transcript coverage decreases exponentially as a function of the distance from the 3’ end and there is a linear relationship between the coverage decay rate and the RNA integrity number (RIN). Conclusions: we found that when using poly-A pulldown techniques for library preparation in RNA-seq, the fusion sensitivity is negatively impacted by both sample degradation and distance of the fusion breakpoint from the 3’ end and developed graphs that show such effect. Such graphs can be useful in assessing the fusion sensitivity of RNA-seq in both research and clinical settings Overall design: Sequencing data was generated using Hiseq 2500 with a library of 101 paired end reads in the rapid run mode"

The prevalence of this disease reaches 10-15% in women of reproductive age which accounts for approximately 200 mln of women worldwide. The existing therapeutic approaches include medications and surgical options, but the risk of post-treatment recurrence of endometriosis remains high. There are currently no effective biomarkers of endometriosis in clinical practice and laparoscopy remains the gold standard for its diagnosis. However, laparoscopy is highly invasive procedure that frequently leads to complications and cannot be used as a routine screening test. In this study we profiled by RNA sequencing 52 endometrial pathological samples and 12 corresponding normal human tissues. We performed two-step differential gene expression analysis of endometrial samples and lesions of patients with endometriosis in comparison with normal reproductive tissues. Based on this analysis we generated a characteristic signature of five genes downregulated in endometriosis with respect to healthy endometrium. The 5-gene expression signature identified had significant predictive power (AUC>0.85) thus suggesting that the marker gene set identified can be used for a low invasive molecular diagnostic of endometriosis. Our data also suggest that the statistical method of five-fold cross validation of differential gene expression analysis procedure can be used for the ability to generate robust gene signatures using real-world clinical data.

Surprisingly, transcriptional variation originating from two different genetic backgrounds was dominant over variation due to the reprogramming method or cell type of origin of pluripotent cell lines. Moreover, the few differences we detected between isogenic hESCs and hiPSCs neither predicted functional outcome, nor distinguished an independently derived, larger set of unmatched hESC/hiPSC lines.

Large-scale screening identified 499 lncRNA loci required for robust cellular growth, of which 89% showed growth modifying function exclusively in one cell type. We further found that lncRNA knockdown can perturb complex transcriptional networks in a cell type-specific manner. These data underscore the functional importance and cell type-specificity of many lncRNAs. Overall design: 96 RNA-seq samples; 16 ChIP-seq samples"

The natural product mixture of curcuminoids that improves certain defects in innate immune cells of AD patients may selectively enhance Aß phagocytosis by alteration of gene transcription. In this work, we evaluated the protective effects of curcuminoids in cells from AD patients by investigating the effect of a panel of curcuminoids on NF-kB and BACE1 signaling pathways by gene expression profiling on the clearance of Beta Amyloid (Aß). Bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDC) showed the most potent protective action to reduce levels of NF-kB and BACE1, decrease the inflammatory cascade and diminish Aß aggregates in cells from AD patients. Moreover, mannosylglycoprotein 4-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (MGAT3) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene mRNAs were up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from AD patients treated with BDC. BDC treatment impacts both gene expression, such as Mannosyl (Beta-1,4-)-Glycoprotein Beta-1,4-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase, Vitamin D and Toll like receptors and Aß phagocytosis. Down-regulation of BACE1 and NF-kB following administration suggests a method to treat asymptomatic AD patients with selective curcumins as a dietary supplement. Overall design: XX AD paients (codes)  were treated with different compounds (YY) and compared to healthy controls with identical treatment."

Methods: We depleted U2AF1 in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to the level found in differentiated cells using an inducible shRNA system, followed by high-throughput RNAseq, revealing a gene expression program involved in cell fate determination. Results: Approximately 85% of the total raw reads were mapped to the human genome sequence (GRCh37), giving an average of 200 million human reads per sample for total RNA and 15 million human reads per sample for small RNA libraries. Conclusions: Our results show that transcriptional control of gene expression in hiPSCs can be set by the CSF U2AF1, establishing a direct link between transcription and AS during cell fate determination.

"human","data_sources/sra","ERP020610",52,"Parallel derivation of isogenic human primed and naive induced pluripotent stem cells","Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have considerably impacted human developmental biology and regenerative medicine, notably because they circumvent the use of cells from embryonic origin and offer the potential to generate patient-specific pluripotent stem cells. However, conventional reprogramming protocols produce developmentally advanced, or primed, human iPSCs (hiPSCs), restricting their use to postimplantation human development modeling. Hence, there is a need for hiPSCs resembling preimplantation naive epiblast. Here, we develop a method to generate naive hiPSCs directly from somatic cells, using OKMS overexpression and specific culture conditions, further enabling parallel generation of their isogenic primed counterparts. We benchmark naive hiPSCs against human preimplantation epiblast and reveal a remarkable concordance in their transcriptome, dependency on mitochondrial respiration and X chromosome status. Collectively, our results are essential for the understanding of pluripotency regulation throughout preimplantation development and generate new opportunities for disease modeling and regenerative medicine."

Here we investigate the use of iPSCs and iPSC-derived cells to study the impact of genetic variation across different cell types and as models for the genetics of complex disease. We established a panel of iPSCs from 58 well-studied Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs); 14 of these lines were further differentiated into cardiomyocytes. We characterized regulatory variation across individuals and cell types by measuring RNA, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation. Regulatory variation between individuals is lower in iPSCs than in the differentiated cell types, consistent with the intuition that developmental processes are generally canalized. While most cell-type- specific regulatory effects lie in chromatin that is open only in the affected cell-types, we find that 20% of cell-type specific effects are in shared open chromatin. Finally, we developed deep neural network models to predict open chromatin regions in these cell types from DNA sequence alone and were able to use the sequences of segregating haplotypes to predict the effects of common SNPs on tissue-specific chromatin accessibility. Our results provide a framework for using iPSC technology to study regulatory variation in cell types that are otherwise inaccessible.

The aim of this study was to characterize changes in TG-specific T cell responses as a function of seasonality. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained either during the pollen season or out of season, from allergic individuals and non-allergic controls were stimulated either with TG extract or a pool of previously identified immunodominant antigenic regions. PBMC from in season allergic subjects exhibit higher IL-5 and IL-10 responses compared to out of season donors. In the case of non-allergic subjects, as expected we observed lower IL-5 responses and robust production of IFN? compared to allergic individuals. Strikingly, non-atopic donors exhibited an opposing pattern with decreased immune reactivity in-season. The broad downregulation in non-allergic donors indicates that healthy individuals are not oblivious to allergen exposure but rather react with an active modulation of the responses following the antigenic stimulus provided during the pollen season. Transcriptomic analysis of allergen-specific T cells defined genes modulated in concomitance with allergen exposure and inhibition of responses in non-allergic donors. Magnitude and functionality of T-helper cell responses differ substantially for in season versus out of season in allergic and non-allergic subjects. The results indicate specific and opposing modulation of immune responses following the antigenic stimulation during the pollen season. This seasonal modulation reflects the enactment of specific molecular programs associated with health and allergic disease. Overall design: 11 allergen-specific T cell RNA samples were analyzed: 5 isolated from PBMC of allergic individuals and 6 from non-allergic individuals (considered as the control group)."

Methods - Cell Culture: Lung adenocarcinoma cell lines NCI-H1975 and HCC827 from a range of passages (2-4) were grown on 3 separate occasions in RPMI media (Gibco) supplemented with Glutamax and 10% fetal calf serum to a 70% confluence. To replicate common experimental conditions cell lines were treated with 0.01% Dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma), which is commonly used as a vehicle in drug treatment experiments. After 6 hours of treatment, cells were collected, snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at -80 degrees C until required. Methods - RNA preparation: Total RNA was extracted from between half a million and million cells using Total RNA Purification Kit (Norgen Biotek) with on-column DNAse treatment accorting to the kit instructions. RNA concentration for each pair of samples to be mixed was equalised to ~100 ng/µl using Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit (Life Technologies). Replicates were pooled in known proportions to obtain mixtures ranging from pure NCI-H1975 (100:0) to pure HCC827 (0:100) and intermediate mixtures ranging from 75:25 to 50:50 to 25:75  NCI-H1975:HCC827. All mixtures corresponding to the second replicate were split into two equal aliquots. One aliquot was left intact (we refer to this as the ''good'' replicate), while the second aliquot was degraded to produce known outlier samples by incubation at 37 degrees C for 7 days in a thermal cycler with a heated lid. 10 µl from each replicated mixture (both good and degraded) were used for Next Generation Sequencing library preparation using two kits: Illumina TruSeq Total Stranded RNA with Ribozero (TotalRNA) and Illumina TruSeq RNA v2 (mRNA) according to the manufacturer''s instructions.

The selective pressures shaping its mutational spectrum, dominated by missense mutations, have remained enigmatic, and neomorphic gain-of-function (GOF) activities have been implicated. We generated isogenic human leukemia cell lines of the most common TP53 missense mutations using CRISPR/Cas9. Functional, DNA binding, and transcriptional analyses revealed loss-of-function (LOF) without GOF effects of missense mutations. Comprehensive mutational scanning of p53 single amino acid variants demonstrated that DNA-binding domain missense variants exert dominant-negative effects (DNE). In mice, DNE of p53 missense variants confer a selective advantage on hematopoietic cells upon DNA damage in vivo. Clinical outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia patients showed no evidence of GOF for TP53 missense mutations. These findings establish dominant-negativity as the primary unit of selection for TP53 missense mutations in myeloid malignancies.

Based on the knowledge that enhanced autophagy is linked to oxidative stress and the DNA damage response, both of which are linked to smoking, we used microarray analysis of the small airway epithelium to identify smoking up-regulated genes known to re-spond to oxidative stress and the DNA damage response. This analysis identified OSGIN1 as significantly up-regulated by smoking in both the large and small airway epithelium (1.8-fold, p<0.01, 2.1-fold, p<10-4, respectively), an observation confirmed by an independent small airway microarray cohort, TaqMan PCR and RNAseq. Genome-wide correlation of RNAseq analysis of airway basal/progenitor cells isolated from healthy subjects (n=17) showed a direct correlation of OSGIN1 mRNA levels to multiple classic autophagy genes, including, LC3B, P62, WIPI1 and ATG13 (all rho>0.7, p<0.01). In vitro cigarette smoke extract exposure of nonsmoker primary airway basal/progenitor cells was accompanied by a dose-dependent up-regulation of OSGIN1 and autophagy induction. Lentivirus-mediated enhanced expression of OSGIN1 in human primary basal/progenitor cells induced puncta-like staining of LC3B and up-regulation of LC3B mRNA and protein and P62 mRNA expression level in a dose and time-dependent manner. OSGIN1-induction of autophagosome / amphistome / autolysosome formation was confirmed by co-localization of LC3B with P62 or CD63 (endosome marker) and LAMP1 (lysosome marker). Induction of autophagy by OSGIN1 is accompanied with heightened oxidative stress. Together, these observations support the concept that smoking-induced up-regulation of OSGIN1 is at least one link between smoking-induced stress and enhanced-autophagy in the human airway epithelium. Overall design: Airway epithelium transcriptome analysis suggested that OSGIN, an oxidative response and cell death induction gene, was up-regulated by cigarette smoking and might be involved in autophagy regulation. In vitro study demonstrated that smoking can increase OSGIN1 expression and enhanced-expression of OSGIN1 led to autophagy, which is accompanied with heightened oxidative stress."

Recently, the lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor (LMPP) has been proposed to be a key propagating population in acute myeloid leukemia (AML; PMID 21251617). We have also shown that LMPPs share many functional and gene expression properties with early thymic progenitors (ETPs; PMID 22344248). This finding is of particular interest as ETP leukemias have recently been described: a distinct and poor prognostic disease entity with a transcriptional profile reminiscent of murine ETPs, showing co-expression of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and myeloid markers (PMID 19147408). Together, this raises the question whether ETPs can act as a leukemia-initiating/propagating cell population; however, relevant disease models to test this hypothesis are currently lacking. Analysis of the genetic landscape of ETP leukemias has revealed frequent coexistence of inactivating mutations of EZH2 and RUNX1 (PMID 22237106). We therefore generated mice with deletions of Ezh2 and Runx1 specifically targeted to early lymphoid progenitors using Rag1Cre (Ezh2fl/flRunx1fl/flRag1Cre+; DKO mice). As anticipated, HSCs lacked significant recombination in DKO mice whereas close to 100% of purified ETPs (Lin-CD4-CD8-CD44+CD25-Kit+Flt3+) showed deletion of Ezh2 and Runx1. Strikingly, despite a 16-fold reduction in thymus cellularity caused by a block in thymocyte maturation at the DN2-DN3 transition, absolute numbers of ETPs within the thymus of DKO mice were markedly expanded (12-fold; p<0.0001). In contrast, Ezh2 or Runx1 deletion alone had no impact on numbers of ETPs. RNA-sequencing of the expanded ETPs in DKO mice revealed upregulation of HSC- and myeloid-associated transcriptional programs, reminiscent of ETP leukaemia e.g. Pbx1 (log2FC=3.0; p<0.0001) and Csf3r (log2FC=1.9; p=0.0038). Single-cell gene expression analysis confirmed co-expression of HSC and myeloid programs with lymphoid genes within individual DKO ETPs. Further, some key regulators of T-cell maturation which are aberrantly expressed in ETP leukemia were also disrupted in DKO ETPs e.g. Tcf7 (log2FC=-9.5; p<0.0001). Gene expression associated with aberrant Ras signalling was also present. However, despite a continued expansion of the ETP population with age, we did not observe leukemia in DKO mice with over 1 year of follow-up. Since ETP leukemias frequently feature activating mutations in genes regulating RAS signaling, we hypothesised that the expanded “pre-leukemic” ETPs in DKO mice would be primed for leukemic transformation by signalling pathway mutation. We therefore crossed DKO mice with a Flt3ITD/+ knock-in mouse line, as internal tandem duplications (ITD) of FLT3 are frequent in ETP leukemias. Ezh2fl/flRunx1fl/flRag1Cre+Flt3ITD/+ (DKOITD) mice showed dramatically reduced survival (median 9.3 weeks) resulting from an aggressive, fully penetrant acute leukemia showing a predominantly myeloid phenotype (e.g. Mac1) but with co-expression of some lymphoid antigens (e.g. intracellular CD3). Crucially, this leukaemia could be propagated in wild-type recipients upon transplantation of the expanded ETPs. DKOITD ETPs were transcriptionally very similar to DKO ETPs, retaining expression of lymphoid alongside HSC- and myeloid-associated genes. Finally, in a lympho-myeloid cell line model (EML cells) we demonstrated that Ezh2 inactivation-induced loss of H3K27me3 is associated with a corresponding increase in H3K27Ac, a transcriptional activating signal that recruits bromodomain proteins. As such, we reasoned that our ETP leukemia model might be sensitive to bromodomain inhibitors such as JQ1. Indeed, we observed high sensitivity of expanded DKOITD ETPs to JQ1, raising the possibility of a new therapeutic approach for ETP leukemias. This novel mouse model of ETP-propagated leukemia, driven by clinically relevant mutations, provides intriguing evidence that leukemias with a predominant myeloid phenotype, but co-expressing lymphoid genes, may initiate within a bona fide early lymphoid progenitor population. Since the functional characteristics of the cell of origin of a leukaemia may direct its progression and response to therapy, these findings could have important implications for future stratification and treatment of both AML and ETP leukemias. Overall design: RNA-sequencing of the LOUCY and JURKAT human leukemia cell lines. Cells were either untreated, treated with DMSO, or treated with the BET inhibitors JQ1 or I-BET151. Samples were obtained from two independent experiments."

By applying high-resolution single cell transcriptomic analyses to Parkinson's iPSC-derived dopamine neurons carrying the GBA-N370S risk variant, we exploited intra-culture cellular heterogeneity to identify a progressive axis of gene expression variation leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Analysis of genes differentially-expressed (DE) along this axis identified the transcriptional repressor histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) as an upstream regulator of disease progression. HDAC4 was mislocalized to the nucleus in PD iPSC-derived dopamine neurons and repressed genes early in the disease axis, leading to late deficits in protein homeostasis. Treatment of iPSC-derived dopamine neurons with compounds known to modulate HDAC4 activity upregulated genes early in the DE axis, and corrected Parkinson's-related cellular phenotypes. Our study demonstrates how single cell transcriptomics can exploit cellular heterogeneity to reveal disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets."

We found that EN1 is overexpressed in TNBCs and its downregulation preferentially and significantly reduces cellular viability and tumorigenicity in TNBC cell lines. Based on RNA-seq and ChIPseq we found that EN1 regulates genes involved in angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and axon guidance in breast cancer cells. Higher expression of EN1 correlates with shorter overall survival among TNBC patients and with higher risk of developing brain metastases. Thus, EN1 is a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target in this particularly lethal subset of TNBCs. Overall design: Bulk RNA-Seq: Gene expression analysis of SUM149 and SUM159 cell lines with TET-inducible shRNA against EN1 with the following variables: Two different shRNA labeled shEN1-1 and shEN1-2, doxycyclin (plus/treatment) and no doxycyclin (minus/control), 3 days and 5 days after doxycyclin treatment.

Thus, one fundamental challenge is to identify molecular and cellular biomarkers of aging that could predict lifespan and be useful in evaluating lifestyle changes and therapeutic strategies in the pursuit of healthy aging. Here, we developed a computational method to predict biological age from gene expression data in skin fibroblast cells using an ensemble of machine learning classifiers. We generated an extensive RNA-seq dataset of fibroblast cell lines derived from 133 healthy individuals whose ages range from 1 to 94 years, and 10 patients with Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), a premature aging disease. On this dataset, our method predicted chronological age with a median error of 4 years, outperforming algorithms proposed by prior studies that predicted age from DNA methylation [4–8] and gene expression data [6,9] for fibroblasts. Importantly, our method consistently predicted higher ages for Progeria patients compared to age-matched controls, suggesting that our algorithm can identify accelerated aging in humans. These results show that the transcriptome of skin fibroblasts retains important age-related signatures. Our computational tool may also be applicable to predicting age from other genome-wide datasets. Overall design: Single end stranded RNA-Seq"

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP163355",70,"RNA-Seq analysis of human lens epithelial cells exposed to ionizing radiation","Purpose: The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recently recommended reducing the occupational equivalent dose limit for the lens of the eye.  Based primarily on a review of epidemiological data, the absorbed dose threshold is now considered to be 0.5 Gy for induction of acute opacities, reduced from the previous threshold of 2 Gy.    However, direct mechanistic evidence to support an understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of damage is still lacking. To this end, we explored the effects of a broad dose-range of ionizing radiation exposure on gene expression changes in a human lens epithelial (HLE) cell-line in order to better understand the shape of the dose-response relationship and identify transcriptional thresholds of effects. Methods: HLE cells were exposed to doses of 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 2, and 5 Gy of X-ray radiation at two dose rates (1.62 cGy/min and 38.2 cGy/min).  Cell culture lysates were collected 20 h post-exposure and analysed using whole-genome RNA-sequencing.  Pathways and dose-thresholds of biological effects were identified using benchmark dose (BMD) modeling. Results: Transcriptional responses were minimal at doses less than 2 Gy. At higher doses there were a significant number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (p < 0.05, fold change > |1.5|) at both dose rates, with 1308 DEGs for the low dose rate (LDR) and 840 DEGs for the high dose rate (HDR) exposure. Dose-response modeling showed that a number of genes exhibited non-linear bi-phasic responses, which was verified by digital droplet PCR.    BMD analysis showed the majority of the pathways responded at BMD median values in the dose range of 1.5-2.5 Gy, with the lowest BMD median value being 0.6 Gy for the HDR exposure. The minimum pathway BMD median value for LDR exposure, however, was 2.5 Gy. Although the LDR and HDR exposures shared pathways involved in extracellular matrix reorganization and collagen production with BMD median value of 2.9 Gy, HDR exposures were more effective in activating pathways associated with DNA damage response, apoptosis, and cell cycling relative to LDR exposure. Conclusion: Overall, the results suggest that radiation induces complex non-linear transcriptional dose-response relationships that are dose-rate dependent. Pathways shared between the two dose rates may be important contributors to radiation-induced cataractogenesis. BMD analysis suggests that the majority of pathways are activated above 0.6 Gy, which supports current ICRP identified dose thresholds for deterministic effects to the lens of the eye of 0.5 Gy. Overall design: HLE cells were exposed to doses of 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 2, and 5 Gy of X-ray radiation at two dose rates (1.62 cGy/min and 38.2 cGy/min).

However, the ability of human PSCs to generate mature cell types is the only imperative property for translational utility. Here, we reveal that the naïve state enhances self-renewal capacity while restricting lineage differentiation in vitro to neural default fate. Gene expression analyses indicate expression of multiple lineage associated transcripts in naïve hPSCs and thus failed to predict biased functional differentiation.  Naïve hPSCs can be converted to primed allowing recovery of multilineage differentiation over long serial passage or immediately through suppression of OCT4 but not NANOG. To this end, we identified chemical inhibitors of OCT4 expression that acutely restore naïve hPSC differentiation. Our study identifies unique cell fate features and critical restrictions in human pluripotent states, and provides an approach to overcome these barriers that harness both efficient naïve hPSC growth whilst maintaining in vitro differentiation capacities essential for hPSC applications. Overall design: hPSC lines were transduced with shRNA lentiviruses in order to assess the effects of reducing NANOG and OCT4 gene expression on differention in the naïve state.  shRNA expressing cells were sorted and then total RNA was extracted in order to perform transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq.
